I want you to find this as easy as possible and it is primarily focused on giving you an easy and straightforward way of handling your thoughts.

<style>
.test {
  background: green;
}
</style>
<div class="test">
Try it yourself using <a href="https://calliope.site" style="color:violet">Calliope</a>
</div>
