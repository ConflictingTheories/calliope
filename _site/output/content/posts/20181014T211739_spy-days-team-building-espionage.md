# Spy Days &#8211; Team Building Espionage
~ 2018-10-14T21:17:39+00:00 ~

How many of you were like me? I wanted to be a spy when I was younger, and I thought it would be the coolest profession. I think many kids want to be spies because of the mystery and intrigue that surrounds the idea. From heroes like James Bond to Evelyn Salt, spies captivate us as a society and keep our creative minds abounding with ideas.

To rekindle my inner spy, I have decided to implement a new team building system at work called Spy Days. The premise is simple, make the team building involve espionage. Why? Because it is fun!

#### Premise

Start with a simple idea – it could be an event that is happening, it could be a contest, or it could be trying to get members to fill out a survey. Whatever it is, this is what we are going to be making into our new espionage-fueled adventure.

The simpler the idea, the easier it is. In this post, we will use two examples:

1. Company Event (Beer Night)
2. Company Gift Card Contest

Once you have your idea(s), it is now time to begin to package it up and prepare it for its new life in the world of spies.

#### Preparation

To prepare the package, we need some **mystery**. The secret recipe to adding mystery is amazingly to leave something out. You are purposefully leaving a hole where there should be information. This is designed to prompt people to figure out what is missing whether they want to or not. Hence, it initializes their inner spies.

So what do we remove, well in the first example normally you would send out an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">invite with a time and date and a location.</span> This time, we will be sending out an invite without that information. Instead we will be sending in an invite with none of the above, but instead a mysterious note, a riddle, and link to a website. From here, they will have to solve the riddle which will give them the next step to find the information on the website. The note can themed in a way to induce the adventure such as “If you should choose to accept this mission…” as well as provide clarity of context.

Before going further, I would like to say that if you are technologically savvy, you can setup Analytics, Bots, and all manner of automated tools to help provide a truly interactive experience. All it takes is some planning and execution. Anyways, back to the second example.

In the first example, we just had to remove some information. In the second example, we need people to enter a contest. Typically, either the contest is random so we only need signups, or the contest is driven by some sort of skill or guess in which case we need them to submit an answer as well. Also, contests tend to have a known prize, which is what entices people to enter. In our example, we aren’t going to list the prize, nor are we going to list the question!

To get people engaged, we are going to leave envelopes on each person’s desk with a small card on the inside and a link to the contest page. On the small card will be a code and nothing else. The link will have an answer box and nothing else. Only with the right answer, will they be submitted into the contest. When they get it right, they will be prompted to pick up their gift card.

#### Execution

Now, the magic begins. Seeing them actually solve the puzzles and become a spy. If you did your job right, the mystery alone should get people talking. They might not know what is happening, but they will probably be talking about it, which is the first step to team building.

Secondly, provided you didn’t make the puzzles too hard or too easy, there should be one or two people who figure it out ahead of everyone else. These are your champions, and their representation and endorsement will be critical to the future success of the idea. Make sure you have something fun lined up for them.

Finally, the first couple puzzles should be fair and allow all people some fun and to get involved. Once you have reached that critical level of engagement, you can begin to really make some of the puzzles trickier. This will up the level of team building along with it, as people will now be enticed to work together to also solve the problems. The other thing to keep in mind, is that it is more fun to vary the types of puzzles you send out. Riddles one week, crosswords the next, and maybe some hidden picture stuff could follow – something for everyone!

#### Conclusion

I hope that Spy Days becomes a more common way to build team spirit and community and company cultures. Rather than doing the same old boring events, lets make it fun and make our team members spies for the day! I will implementing it at my work next month and plan on having one to two events a month going forward.
