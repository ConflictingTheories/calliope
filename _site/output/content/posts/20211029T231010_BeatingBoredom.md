# Beating Boredom
~ 2021-10-29-T16:10:10+00:00 ~

Since the world has been content to discriminate against those who aren't complying with the vaccine mandates, I have been finding myself with a lot less avenues of entertainment. At least those which are provided as services to the public.

Second class citizens such as myself are deemed unfit vermin for the common areas, such that even some less-than-savoury landlord (read criminals) are attempting to enforce illicit policy in direct violation of the Human rights code and more. Oh well, the law will not be kind to them since it appears that most infractions come at considerable expense especially when considering the fact that one fine could be the equivalent to a year or more of profits for that same person. I myself hope they bleed these companies dry if they wish to abuse human rights. Its a blood tax imo for their immoral attitudes. But luckily, I haven't face any concerns myself yet.

However, I find myself unable to club easily, so it is better that I bring the beats to myself. I have been practicing some basic DJing now that I am an uncouth swine according the illiterate.

Well, I didn't really enjoy the clubs - however I will miss the restaurants. Shame really - backbones and spines are in short supply in the mordern world. 

Any ways - if you wish to hear some of my music mixing while I learn this new skill, check out my stream, [ConflictingTheories](https://conflictingtheories.com).
