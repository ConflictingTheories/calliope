# Predictions for this Decade &#8211; 2020-2025 (Part 1 / 2)
~ 2020-03-21T17:31:29+00:00 ~

I feel like I would like to present some of my opinions as to what I believe this next decade will bring us. I have plenty of forecasts in mind, so I think I will do this by categories and within those categories I will include my predictions.

To start, I will focus primarily on the first 5 years and what I foresee occuring within that time, and in my following post I will conclude with my predictions for the final 5 years rounding out the decade.

The reason I would like to do this, is that sometimes when you aggregate the same data into different buckets, you get different results. Rather than pump up my numbers and make predictions seem better than they aught to be by lumping all the predictions into 10 years, I will be presenting them within smaller defined timeboxes in a form of over-under.

If I am correct in my assumptions of both this decade and the timebox, then it is more indicative of a good prediction, for I may well get the prediction in the other timebox which can provide some valuable insight and corrective logic.

One of the reasons I chose to start a blog and keep my digital record is that I wanted to ensure that I had a record for myself and others. I keep physical records in the form of journals for the same purposes and believe that ideas are best dealt with by first copying them down. Then you can clearly think unencumbered.

Predictions for 2020-2025
-------------------------

To make this article more consumable the predictions have been grouped into categories. Feel free to skip categories which are not of interest to you.

### Technology

- Finally, see the beginning of consumer smart glasses hit the market (far from their potential)
- Smart wearables (besides glasses) will begin to become more prevalent in everyday life such as watches and the beginnings of smart jewelry.
- Mobile devices will incorporate better batteries for longer durations and will approach 3-5 days in average between charges.
- A new operating system for mobile devices will show up that is neither iOS as we know it, nor Android, but will not reach mass adoption by manufacturers yet.
- Digital payments will become the norm, and different types of digital wallets will begin to gain mass adoption -some for loyalty programs and others for Fiat currencies.
- Video gaming will change into a more subscription based, episodic form of entertainment. Games will be available for rent via online marketplaces and the idea of owning games outside of specific consoles will begin to fade and will be replaced by indie-developers. This will lead to a resurgence in “Vintage” games amongst fans much like vinyl of today.
- Distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and Cryptocurrencies will begin to finally gain more commercial acceptance. Banks will begin to offer DLT backed services and investments. New markets will be explored that are driven by utility application and not speculation.
- The streaming industry will fragment, but smaller players who can’t adopt market shares beyond 10% will be acquired by the others.
- More and more people will be using online software platforms in their daily routines and will become more dependent on them to do their jobs.
- Open-source projects will continue to grow, but more and more companies will be using them to power paid services which will cause increased division between the community and the corporate entities who fail to support them. Apple will begin to slowly support open source projects.

### Politics

- Universal Basic Income will become a hot button topic amongst the European nations. It will be discussed in North America as well, but it will face stronger opposition due to the free-market principles being enshrined in the US. This will lead to pilot projects in Europe (and possibly Canada) but the States will likely only have it in certain states like New York and California.
- Populism will continue for the next 5 years – but to differing degrees and about different trending issues. The focus is going to be on autonomy, growth and trade. It will be less about religion or race and more about resources and industry.
- Health will be a big focus for socialist countries, while it will become a large problem in the US and the UK.
- We will see a new war erupt in the middle east, but it will be economic first – possibly with Russia involved – Other countries will join in to resolve it when it becomes violent (NATO).
- China will be ever involved in world politics and will seek to be at the centre of world trade and research – it will become the biggest rival to the US and replace Russia from the cold war – this could lead to a new cold war between China and the US – one not based on weapons, but on technology, research and information.
- The will be some major fronts: EURO-US Relations, CHINA-US Relations, MIDDLE EAST Relations, CHINA-AFRICA Relations, US-SOUTH AMERICA Relations, RUSSIA Relations.

### Economy

- The economy is going to enter a Bear market and will spend the first 2 years struggling to correct itself from the past decade+ of a bull market. It will then slowly climb back out and will approach the levels we saw prior to the decade and will enter another bull market which will take us higher into the last half of the decade.
- Supply chain will be one of the largest contributing factors to our global health and general wellness, and it will be primary focus for new businesses, startups, and fierce competition will emerge. Many companies are vying to be the leader in global supply chain and this will be a time for them to invest heavily.
- Remote work, Gig Work, and the idea of mobility and freedom will become very important issues for individuals when the economy starts to get weaker – they will want ways to feel more secure and not dependent on a single source of income should it dry up. This will lead to entire support industries forming to facilitate this – including online platforms, remote HR companies, and along with it – privacy concerns.
- Countries are going to be looking to vertically integrate their own infrastructures through foreign investment such that they can bring foreign money in and will be investing in foreign companies more and more to help diversify their holdings and bring them stability across the markets when they aren’t doing so well at home.
- Automated industries will become more and more prevalent over the coming years. They will be under pressure to regulate, but no actions will be done – this will cause some wealth distribution problems in regions which previously depended on those jobs.
- Trade wars are going to be increasing across the globe and sanctions will be imposed against foreign nations in response to global competition. The difficulties in the economy will be make it easier for populist governments to impose their sanctions and I expect to see trade relations look a lot more like they did in the 80’s.

### Health

- Health will be a big issue across the globe. It will be one of the fastest growing industries and will focus heavily into new areas of research. I expect there to be large developments in drug manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and therapies.
- Genetic modifications will grow in popularity and legal pilot projects will be announced near the middle of the decade for human testing and trials.
- The idea of humans being mortal will be challenged, but it will see no breakthroughs during this time.

### Environment

- The environment will continue to be a hot topic. We will see growing levels of awareness as well as some doomsday-saying. Mental health will start to be affected in groups who are most affected by these discussions.
- We will see continuous hypocrisy from both nations, individuals and companies regarding how they address the environment.
- Nepotism will flourish and new oligarchies are likely to develop under the guise of environmental regulations, protections, and agencies across the globe.
- The planet will see little to no changes during this time because of our actions (for good or bad)

### Science

- New advancements in Space travel will continue and we will see a new industry in space emerge (but not be active yet)
- Quantum mechanics will be further refined and there will be a new breakthrough that helps unify the models – but no unified model will be found.
- Mathematics will show new uses in the fields of astrophysics and they will be able to model further phenomena and have a clearer picture of the past than ever before.
- AI will cease to be the most popular topic for the next 5 years – general populations will become more fluent with the concepts and differences between machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### Culture

- Piracy will increase to new levels beyond those of the past decade and will resume the arms-race between companies and pirates – this will force almost all distribution to tighten their license agreements and pursue legal actions.
- EGaming will become a bigger industry than professional sports.
- Digital Advertising revenues will continue to climb year-after-year amongst the large advertising platforms.
