Predictions for 2025-2030
-------------------------

To make this article more consumable the predictions have been grouped into categories. Feel free to skip categories which are not of interest to you.

### Technology

- Consumer smart wearables become everyday items of most people and reach mass market adoption. Each generation brings increasingly new improvements over the previous – many companies will be in this space initially, much like MP3 players and cameras.
- Battery life will almost double over this period of time and will be approaching 10-14 days for most small popular devices that people carry around with them.
- There will be 3-4 major players in the mobile space in terms of operating systems as opposed to the two we have today (iOS and Android) – One will be focused on industrial applications and will not be targeting consumers.
- Cash will be reduced in circulation and will slowly be removed in higher denominations. Bullion will be still in place and certain denominations will remain in circulation but in less prevalence outside of small business and cash industries.
- Console gaming will merge with PC gaming to be mainly cloud gaming. Platforms will act a lot like streaming services and will provide different controllers and reward networks.
- Digital currencies and distributed technologies will be ubiquitous and nearly accepted everywhere.
- Video streaming and music streaming will continue with more of a focus on live concert events, streaming artists, and real-time publishing. There will be new interactive music and videos that will engage users beyond just the primary sense.
- Remote work will be the norm and simulated environments will be used for more dangerous work. Labour will be needed and retail will shift to a more social experience as a opposed to a shopping experience. People will be looking for areas to work in – but these will be more like libraries and coffee shops of today – but not limited to just those.

### Politics

- Partisan politics will slowly diverge and melt into general politics and fringe politics. Fringe groups will be active online, but will not necessarily gain social acceptance outside and most people will align with similar views in person for fear of reprisals. This will cause a feeling of uneasiness amongst the general population.
- Anonymous support groups will form to help all different types of political affiliations and there will be online wars between them.
- Europe will grow divisive and more countries will close up their borders and seek isolationism – nationalism will begin to rise again.
- China will begin to crack down on its citizens and will begin to annex nearby regions – meanwhile its economic force will be stronger in Africa.
- North America will begin to socialise their economies more, and will move towards a more socio-scientific economy. Manufacturing will be automated more and additional states will begin to provide wellfare support and universal basic income.
- The Middle East will remain in religious debate and will continue to remain in wars and conflicts. Iran will see a change of government, Israel will annex the West Bank, and Saudi Arabia will begin to lose confidence on the world stage.
- Africa will be gutted of its mineral resources from the interior while it will begin to develop its manufacturing and robotics factory industries on the coasts. Some countries will remain extremely poor while others will make large strides to wealth and prosperity.
- Australia will be more focused on environmental effects, but will slowly become more xenophobic and will enter with trade wars with Asia.

### Economy

- The economy of the world will be ever increasing throughout this period. There will be higher interest rates, faster inflation, and we will see an explosion of GDP in all currently developed countries.
- South America will begin to stabilise its economies and will slowly begin to increase its tourism to become the # 1 tourist destination in the world.
- Asia will become more industrialised and tourism will decrease in the east due to conflicts, disease, and embargoes.
- Russia will enter a recession and will turn to more desperate measures – there will be loss of confidence in the government.
- Europe will be splintered due to the wealth disparity. Some countries like Ireland and the UK will be doing well, other countries like Spain and Italy will be suffering some hardships.
- Canada is likely to expand its space industry out east, focus on tourism in the west and will reduce its resource development. A shift to more technology will be on the horizon and we will begin to provide some of the world leading cloud data centres.

### Health

- We begin to see more cybernetic enhancements and fancier prosthetic limbs
- AIDS and HIV will be officially cured and no longer a terminal illness
- Health care will be one of the world’s leading issues next to environment.
- With an ageing population, we will see a large uptick in financial costs associated with health care across the globe.

### Environment

- Environment will continue to be a topic of discussion, but the arguments will be less polarizing. People will debating what to do and not whether to do something or not.
- Corruption scandals will begin to break in the environmental groups and agencies and there will be issues with accountability.
- The world will be no better off or worse off than it is now.
- Coral reefs and animal extinction will be the largest environmental threats over the next decade.

### Science

- We will have improved propulsion systems for space travel
- We will have officially prepared a trip for Mars
- We will setup a test base on the moon
- We will discover a previously unknown intelligent life-form (past or present)
- We will discover a new form of life (not intelligent)

### Culture

- We will begin to understand how to live in a distributed world. People will no longer have the same routines (9-5) but will instead be more mobile.
- Shopping will be more interactive and will be a hybrid between digital and real life experiences.
- Music, media, and movies will still hold cultural relevance, but they will be increasingly changing their distribution platforms and will be updating their formats to appeal to ever changing tastes.
- Space will become less of a far off topic and something to be looking forward to in the next generation.
- The world will be fully connected digitally and you will have almost complete coverage of the globe for internet access. (90-95% of people will have it)

Conclusions
-----------

I hope you enjoyed reading about my predictions for the next decade and are probably now thinking about your own. I encourage you to write them down either via a blog such as this or use social media, or some journals, but write them down and try to come back in 10 years and see how you stacked up. =\]
