# SpyDays &#8211; So far a success

I little while back I posted about an idea I was eager to try out at work focused on getting better engagement from everybody to foster team building and a stronger community. The idea was called SpyDays.

The premise behind SpyDays is to come up with a spy (espionage) themed community driven contest or challenge. It could be a short one-day only event, or it could be a longer more culture-infused campaign. I decided to make our SpyDays an ongoing, community hub. Rather than just focus on a single event, I decided to turn it into a real-life game.

I launched it at work last week, and so far it appears to be quite a success. Everyone was quite engaged and was running around in their spare time to try and solve puzzles and find clues. They don’t know what they are going to get for winning, and no prize was promised – just a mystery email and personalised note (personalised to their agent name that is) requesting their acceptance of a mission. I hid some envelopes with clues around their offices and then I proceeded to hide even more around the general floor – inside the kitchen, the hallways, etc…

They will still have to figure out where to input the clues, for I have designed a website and hosted it at a hidden location for them to discover. When they get there, they will need all the answers from their quest to get into the system, but once inside they will be rewarded with their prize (or perhaps their next clue).

I have now decided to enhance the game, for I can use the web portal as a means to convey new hints, clues, puzzles, and answers. I can also use it a means of tracking their participation via analytics and I can better yet do things that are other wise hard in practice – such as develop a system of double agents for gamification, points, and even quests and achievements. They will all have a profile in the system and soon enough they can start to customise it.

All this isn’t for anything other than give people some more fun at work. I always believe that having fun and games is important for morale, so I encourage anyone who reads this to consider implementing their own version of SpyDays at their company.
