# A New Horizon
~ 2020-06-24T03:57:13+00:00 ~

I have decided to pursue some new avenues in my life and I handed in my notice this week. I havenâ€™t got a new job lined up, but I felt it was time for a change. Despite the challenges I am feeling confident in my abilities and I am optimistic about the future. I had trouble letting go, so by making this first step, I think I will be better suited to launch myself into the new horizon.
