# Spare Time &#8211; New Hobbies
~ 2020-08-16T22:22:33+00:00 ~

Since I have been with so much time on my hands while I continue to look for a job – I have inevitably been required to find ways of filling it. Now, I am always trying to be somewhat productive so I felt that now was the best time to try out some new hobbies and see if anything really stuck with me.

So far these are the new hobbies I have tried while job hunting these past weeks:

- **Gundam Model Kit Building (also known as Gunpla)**
- **Twitch Streaming &amp; Twitch Bot Coding**
- **Game Design / Story Writing**
- **EBay Selling / Flipping Products**

Those are all things I had never tried before this so in some ways I am already thankful for having made this decision to move ahead in my life. I can say the following about each:

#### Gundam Model Building

Gundam Models are way more intricate and far more articulate than I had thought. I have enjoyed building the two that I have finished (see photos) and I think I will likely do a couple more in the future. This is a great way to spend 10-15 hours per model and they take a lot more work than I was originally anticipating as well. Of course I have been pretty basic with mine and I have not looked into any sort of weathering or customization yet.

#### Twitch Streaming

 I had never watched Twitch, let alone thought about streaming on it, but when I found myself with a lot of free time I decided to give it a shot. Since I am a creative person, so I preferred the idea of streaming rather than consuming the content – so while I have now watched a couple other people stream, I have spent far more time streaming my own content.

Streaming on Twitch has been fun but also tiring. It takes a lot of energy to get in front of the camera for hours on end and be able to be interesting. I am new and I have not really found what resonates with viewers yet, but so far I have struggled to maintain viewers who do happen to stop by. At the same time, I have more appreciation for content creators who do put in the effort and reap the rewards – while the enjoyment and creative nature has been enough of its own reward so far – I could see it taking considerable effort to build up a fan base and to make a strong community.

I will continue to try and do some streaming from time to time, but I first have to figure out my niche – if streaming is not the niche for me – I may instead look at doing video casts and pod casts from the same perspective except rather than focus on Twitch, I will likely turn my attention to YouTube and other video hosting platforms. Perhaps with a longer lead time and a chance to garner a following that way, I can amplify my small streaming audience. Regardless, I have enjoyed the experience and will likely do more with video in general in the future.

#### Game Design / Story Writing

I have always wanted to work on developing a AAA title for a game company, so I decided to begin to flesh out some of my game ideas into more than just loose threads in my mind. I looked around and got a sense of what some components are inside of game’s script, proposal, and general design.

My hope is that once I am done with a couple stories fleshed out, I can then have something to work on without having to do everything all at once. This will allow me to begin to learn more about game development by having a project to be passionate about to work towards.

I also think that the experience of writing some game designs and drafting lores and worlds will be in itself again a rewarding process. I have only just started this and I cannot say I have enough hours under my belt to have developed any sort of opinion yet, but I am enjoying the process thus far of laying out the various components of game such as characters, objects, locations, events, and the plot. I haven’t started thinking about assets as I am not particularly strong in graphic design or 3D modelling when I tried it in the past – however, I may be tempted if this continues and I am remaining on the hunt for work – to take it back up.

#### Ebay Selling

The final hobby that I have taken up recently is that of Ebay Selling. I have purchased many a time on Ebay, but until recently I had never gone through the process of selling through Ebay. So far I have sold 5 Items and I have a few more listed which I am hoping to sell soon. All the items were items I had previously – mostly old video games of mine.

I would say the experience has been a bit of hit and miss. The first couple items I posted we bought and sold almost immediately and I was left with the feeling that this was too easy and sure enough the following items were not nerely as quick – nor were they as lucrative. Unfortunately while I have made enough to cover the other hobbies I have started, I did not see the cashflow or opportunities for much more in the future. While I will certainly keep my options open as to using Ebay in the future, it really is not as convenient as I would like.

The biggest complaint I have is that they hold the funds on each sale (probably because I am new), and on top of that they limit the amount you can list both in price and in quantity. This makes it very difficult to use it as a source of any real income as the initial starting amounts are rediculously low and not enough to live off of and then they arbitrarily hold it until it gets processed for delivery by the post system (which currently is delayed).

All in all – while it has provided the funds and means for the other hobbies and it was the only one, it is also the one with the most considerations, the most catches, and the most laborious process. Again – this will not become a hobby going forward, but will remain an option for me to sell items.

In closing, I have enjoyed these opportunities to spend the time and try out these new hobbies. While not each was a roaring success, they have all been positive in some measure and each have been insightful with some new experiences. Thank you for your time and I hope you found this interesting.
