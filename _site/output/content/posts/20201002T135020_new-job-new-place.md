# New Job &#038; New Place

October will be a big month for me. I recently signed an offer to start a new position soon, so my multi-month job-hunt journey is coming to an end. It was quite the adventure and like all job hunts – I found myself beginning to lose hope at the last minute. Waves of joy as new interviews would come in followed by a crushing sense of defeat as each rejection email slithered its way across the my inbox. Schedules were packed and hectic – mixed between the hunting, the applying, the interviewing, the phone screens, the emails, the on-sites, the online forms, the surveys, challenges, proctored exams, the take-home assignments, and the umpteen dozen different tools used to video chat and communicate in some form or fashion. Over the last two and half months of job hunting I applied for over 75 jobs – receiving some form of feedback from approximately 30% of them. It was always annoying when you wouldn’t hear back at all from these companies – and I always wondered what it was that stopped me from getting a chance – was it my resume / cover letter, was it personal (that can happen despite being rare), or was it some AI/criteria rubric I failed to answer or match? These little unknowns are the most vexing because they could be wholly subjective or represent a larger underlying narrative that could be corrected. From the interviews I did have, it seemed like most were on page with my resume and no one really ever mentioned any negatives – however, I do not know if people do say negatives or prefer to omit said things.

In addition, to the new job, I have also decided to move to a new place – I need to escape this neighbour of mine – he is truly an annoying person to live next to. He is well-meaning in his mind I am sure, but in practice it comes off as disrespectful and defiant. He believes himself perfectly allowed to blast the bass of his speakers deep into the night (8PM-6AM) for his friend’s parties, birthdays, and all manner of get-togethers enough that my chest vibrates at times from it. When asked to turn down the bass – he is the kind of neighbour who replies – “what bass? there is no bass man” – while the walls vibrate @ 5 in the morning…. So lets just say I am excited to be moving. Hopefully he gets evicted, but in the meantime I don’t plan to wait around and find out and I don’t wish to see his next drug fueled mistakes come to fruition such as his pleas for help while having a bad time on some acid as I came home from grocery shopping with shopping bags in each hand. Then I have to spend two hours helping remove random people from his apartment and eventually just get police in to help deal with it. Yes, I am happy to be free of this guy and his awful aura – he really is just dreadful live next to – sure he is great at parties though.
