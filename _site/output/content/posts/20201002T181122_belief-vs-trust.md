# Belief vs Trust
~ 2020-10-02T18:11:22+00:00 ~

I have been thinking about the concepts of belief vs trust. I think the two concepts get conflated frequently, but I am not so sure they are as alike as may be first thought.

On the one hand you have belief which is something without proof or support in typically rational terms yet garners a following and confidence about it. On the other side you have trust – which is something which is given much like a median of exchange or a badge of honor. It can be removed and broken, but is typically grounded in some form of subjective proof or promise from another party.

When we look at some of the financial discussion surrounding bitcoin and digital currencies, we see the word trust brandished about quite frequently – but we rarely see any such concept of belief within financial markets except perhaps within the hearts and minds of day traders.

I find it curious that while the concept of trust is fundamental to our whole financial system – the concept of belief is almost wholly absent. This leads credence to my statement at the beginning of this article – they are far different and not alike.

What would a financial world look like if we had a mechanism for including belief intrinsically within it as opposed to what we have now which is an absence of such tools. I think this could be the missing part of my theory I have been striving to work out – one involving a fully decentralised economy without central banks or stock exchanges.

By generating a financial mechanism to tap into belief, I feel we could better utilize it in terms of debt creation, currency issuance, and innovation on a societal level. I think we could finally have the means to empower individuals without needing anything more than the sheer belief of those who see value in your idea.

So long till next time.
