# Smarter Documents

It is time we experienced smarter documents – beyond the current commercial offerings. I want smart documents that act like software, but read like a book, brochure, manual, email, etc, and act like a file.

I am not talking about jazzing up PDF’s – that is possible and there are some neat examples of creative things people have managed to do – but it has its limitations (usually based on the reader) – not to mention the security attacks etc. What I am talking about documents which act like apps.

Now, some of you may say just go full-bore and build an app then, but I like to think a bit bigger than that and instead envision a new smart-doc standard which fully integrates all the greats of the PDF spec alongside a bunch of new features. Features like: auto-distribution, built-in version control, rolling-releases, distributed content, and automatic data binding &amp; auto-generated reporting.

Imagine a document format which could poll the latest data, update its charts &amp; tables, provide integrated security and authentication mechanisms when opened or at certain sections, print like a report on paper or static PDF, provide collaboration and even offer distributed sharing and backups. It could be emailed and shared – but each time you visit it – you get fresh content – but better yet – imagine it was an open standard – with a simple opensource community to support it.

None of this is new technology – each sub-component is already available or proven – it is just a combination into a more digital type of document format.
