I recently have been reading a bit about Koans and have trying to think about them more in my daily routines. I have a desire to get back into meditation and reach my previous skill level, so I am hoping that koans will provide me some much needed escapes from reality to ponder some deeper questions.

In that vein, I recently had a thought (more of a question) that I almost consider a type of koan â€“ albeit I think it is more of meta-thought as there is not much of a paradox within it. But I have included it below for your convenience.

Thanks for reading!

In closing I add: *For does a blind man know to ask what colour is the sky?*
