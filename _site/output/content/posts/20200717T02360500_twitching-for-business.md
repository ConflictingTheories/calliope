# Twitching for Business 👾🐙
~ 2020-07-17T02:36:05+00:00 ~

I have done it. I have joined up to Twitch and have started streaming. My Channel will be called: **👾 ConflictingTheories** 🐙. You may now continue breathing.

Since I have been job hunting and have a lot more free time on my hands, I have decided to give my hand at streaming, video blogging, and recording. I will be trying Twitch out first (primarily for streams) and then plan on moving towards more consistent content, clips, etc.

I want to have a YouTube channel (possibly some more) which I can use to promote additional content, media, and my creations. Just as when I started this blog, I have found a need to express myself in a new way (whilst retaining my previous modes. Some stuff is just better expressed with a voice and expressions. (I talk with my hands a lot!)

Please consider following along with me: https://twitch.tv/kderbyma

My topics will be loosely around the following:

- Politics / World Events
- Programming / Technology
- History &amp; Philosphy
- Video Games &amp; Hobbies
- Interviews &amp; Reviews (Eventually)

Enjoy and I hope to see you in the chat! =\]
