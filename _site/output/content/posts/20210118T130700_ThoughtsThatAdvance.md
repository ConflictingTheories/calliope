# Thoughts that advance
~ 2021-01-18T13:07:00+00:00 ~

What if there are some thoughts which are more powerful than others. I doubt many people would immediately argue this point, but I also think it is likely to be overlooked and dismissed due to the almost obviousness of the statement. What I mean is that there are various ideas such as Rocco Basilisk and other such concepts which utilize this underlying principle, but at the same time they don't seem to fully abstract the problem at hand.

I ask this because wouldn't it be great if you could learn concepts better purely by having the right presentation of the idea, but done in a way that could be auto-correcting for each individual. Some people may need the ideas in a rhyming fashion for it to resonate within their concsciousness, but for others it may best be shown through visual stimulation, or rote mathetics where possible.

It would be great if we could somehow measure the shape and colour of the thoughts themselves and find commonality between them such that we could translate one medium to the next and truly enhance our understanding of the world.
