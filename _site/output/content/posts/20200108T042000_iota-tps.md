# IOTA &#8211; TPS?

I have been working with IOTA this year for a project at work and it has been a lot of learning and a lot of rebasing. What I mean by rebasing has mainly to do with expectations and assumptions.

When I read the whitepaper, and I looked into some of the articles and documents being written about it – it kept promoting the Tangle as this solution to Blockchain’s bottleneck and that it would provide efficient throughput and better yet – scale AND improve as more users and more activity occurred. One such article claimed that a simple node should be capable of managing 100 transactions per second which should scale to 100’000’s of transactions per second for a Tangle interconnected with lots of nodes.

Great, so why am I seeing 9-10 TPS? This seems like we have a big disconnect between the theoretical throughput and reality in the present. This has presented some challenges of its own. Hopefully, they can get back onto the theoretical track.
