# New Years Revolutions

I have made some progress on Calliope and I have included a new plugin for IPFS based file hosting and streaming. Particularly for videos and audio. I feel it is more important than ever to ensure that we can have freedom of information and continue to champion what the web was all about. It was not about platforms and aggregating the most users and views, although those things are always nice. It was and shall always be about the creation and proliferation of ideas.

If we forget what the web stands for - if we begin to for some reason believe that it represents or is supposed to represent the status quo, the norms of society, or in someway is supposed to "keep up" - we are forgetting that we don't dictate the way the world works. We should be a part of it, but not its puppet masters - nor should we support them.
