I find myself in a constant state of ideation. I can’t help it. I am addicted to thinking about new ideas. It is actually becoming a problem for me and I feel it is negatively impacting my happiness.

But why? What are these ideas you may be asking – let me tell you.

Old !== New == Old ? Proceed : Halt
-----------------------------------

Old ideas are boring to me, and if I cannot come up with a new way of thinking about it, I quickly get disinterested and feel the same way about the idea as I do about having the same left-overs for 3 days in a row.

While I enjoying reading and learning about other people’s ideas – they inevitably spur me into a creative state of mind where I immediately begin to abstract away from the idea and try to redefine it in a new or different way.

At the core of this – is a an internal obsession to lay new ground. I am obsessed about leaving a legacy – in particular, an ideological legacy. I desire to break new ground in thought – but its becoming an true nightmare in some ways.

P = NP?

In my mind all ideas exist in an n-space of some parameters, axioms, and relationships. However, this idea may have multiple solutions, simplifications, and even expressions so how can I know the “Truth” of it. I am on the hunt for the universal map to ideas and I believe such a thing exists – perhaps it is akin to a religious fanaticism in a way – I have no proof or reason I can point to, but in my heart of hearts and deep in my psyche I believe it to be true.

I dream that in my lifetime I will find some new meaning, purpose, law, or truth about the state of reality and that I will have the chance to leave my legacy behind through the formalisation and dissemination of the idea – but I have nightmares that I have already stumbled upon such a fitting quest but have since buried it under far more trivial pursuits that have since bubbled to the forethought of my mind. How can one know which idea is worthy of pursuit prior to having completed them all and measured the results?

How can I formulate my ideas, validate them, explore them, and put forth all the necessary energy to fulfil on them without casting aside the opportunity of other ideas that may come along. How can I avoid wasting my efforts on less-than-worthy problems but at the same time commit to one without the true state of its outcomes resolved. This is my struggle – my constant FOMO.
