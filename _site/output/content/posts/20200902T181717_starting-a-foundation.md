# Starting a foundation?

How does one go about starting a foundation? I ask because I feel the need to form one. There are lots of issues I feel quite passionate about, but I fail to see enough being done to address those areas. I definitely do not think I am necessarily the best to lead such a foundation, but I have yet to find one which I can align with and feel reassured. The issue I face is that most of my intentions would hardly fall into the traditional buckets of any classical economic model.

My interests are almost meta in nature – I wish to develop a foundation that can hopefully help promote the means of a decentralized economic model – one which is almost fully imcompatible with any that exists today (except perhaps on a truly macro-scale). My goal of this foundation is to form a body to first establish and layout the vision of this model, but more importantly begin the necessary work of building the infrastructure of the foundation itself to fulfill the vision.

By focusing on both the vision and the infrastructure necessary to begin down the path towards said vision, I hope that it can provide both the concepts as well as the means for others to join suit and push forward on this new model.

### Vision of this Foundation?

The vision is still a bit vague in my mind as I roll it around and discover some of the rough parts, but the general gist is this:

- Provide the means of Capital Issuance to the General population (we are our own banks)
- Provide a means of Exchange to the general population (no more SEC / regulation on Trade / WTO / Etc.)
- Provide a means of collaterization beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and property and create a future collaterization mechanism (much like an option)
- Focus on promoting innovation and economic mobility without interest and inflation through new financial vehicles
- Provide a means of Pseudonomity wihtout sacrificing authentication and validation mechanisms
- Provide an open standard which is not centralized or controlled through ANY governing body
- Recognize that inflation is an evil concept which in the past was useful, but has grown beyond that benefit.
- A system IS what is what it DOES (not what is claims or intends)
- A system MUST support itself WHOLLY and be CLOSED.
- Organizations should be free to reassociate and disassociate at the behest of their membership and should be free to separate (much like a fork of a software project)
- Patents / IP must never be used to RESTRICT production, supply or servicies.

### Outcomes?

The above may seem a little extreme to many – but I envision a world which no central banks exist – no central currencies, and a completely different tax system which exists to promote innovation, and not bloating and bureaucracy.

The true vision of my model is to empower the individual beyond anything the world has every presented. I want true mobility – built on the backs of ones own WORD. Not some Bank’s criteria, rubrics or anything else. Lets your history speak for itself (not their interpretation of your history).

No more credit agencies who suck personal information, have the audacity to use dark patterns in their products and effectively control the fates of the economy to a such a massive degree that it should be criminal. And the focus is to remove the horribly entrenched and false sense of property ownership as we see it today which has done little except to provide means of capital hoarding and anti-competitive profit-mongering.

Shouldn’t we have more agency in our lives about our finances? Shouldn’t we be able to take on debt if WE believe we can handle it – why does everybody implicitly trust the banking organizations who have proven time and time again to be so incapable that they demand additional regulations (thus burdening us with more bureaucracy and inefficiency through design).

### Getting Started?

My idea of getting started is a simple one – perhaps all that is required is to start with a pilot project. A network of like minded individuals who agree to accept the payment of this new economy just as if it were a centralized one. A sort of bond of fellowship between patrons who value humankind and our future contributions and potential.

A way of slowly forming a shadow network – one beyond any bank, institution, or generalized ledger of a fixed currency. Even bitcoin fails to make this vision (as it too focuses on a central currency) and should one day Satoshi decide to use their fortune of bitcoin, it too will become effectively a centrally controlled issuance system (for Satoshi will become the central bank themselves). I believe that such a system is still open to corruption (from Satoshi himself) but in a world where his Satoshis could be nullified or scaled down properly (ie. a Satoshi bitcoin would not hold the weight of one freshly mined) – but since Bitcoin was not designed to accomodate such a system – it fails to provide the infrastructure for my vision.

So far the closest I have found is funny enough in platforms which support Exchange functionality moreso than currency functionality. Many such platforms have been built, but the closest to what I may build from would have to be either Stellar (XLM) or Ripple (XRP) – still neither of which fully realize the vision and would still require massive adjustment.

Hopefully, given some more time and research I will begin to figure out this problem and perhaps can one day begin work towards my vision. Thanks for reading and take care.
