> <cite>Proxeny was an institution of interstate relations in the ancient Greek world. A sort of social network in the ancient empire. A city-state granted proxeny to the citizen of another community, the status of being their proxenos within that individual’s home city. They facilitated relationships, trade and acted as ambassadors between the states.</cite>

The **Proxi Initiative** is a vision of a new paradigm that aims to revolutionize the way that business is done globally and move society towards a more declarative state of existence – less encumbered by the hassles and inefficiencies of the current status quo. Think of it as a digital governance layer and services infrastructure – it replaces traditional institutional bureaucratic systems with one of a more flexible and less political nature.

Proxi will have succeeded when people no longer think in terms of traditional governance structures and identities and have come to embrace a new way of doing business and managing our civilization. Borders will become less important and governments will shrink their institutions – people will be communicate more through shared values instead of shared nomenclature or jurisdictions.

Trade will begin to become synonymous with business again and individuals will be empowered more than anytime in the last 150 years whilst retaining all our cultural and technological benefits we have reaped. Artisans, creators, and innovators will be given the freedom to grow whilst those who prefer comfort and security can have it their way – no more butting heads or lobbying.

Proxi is not a single offering or product – it is instead a vision of a collection of services and standards which work in harmony together to each provide significant individual value (stand-alone components) whilst combining to provide a greater offering when combined.

Proxi aims to empower all of its users in a mutualistic yet independent nature. All participants will form a ‘Network’ – the Proxi Network. It is through this network that we can provide the scale necessary whilst also providing the availability and redundancy necessary to support the platform.

Early growth will be focused on some of the core components themselves, but in time the platform will become larger and more integrated. The focus from the beginning will be to reduce control mechanisms beyond those of standards and rules of governance – this will be designed to ensure that power cannot be concentrated in time, and that body of power can destroy or take advantage of the network. The aim is for the network to always be beneficial to its members and not accidentally become parasitic (such as many networks eventually become).

Some of products which will be focused early on will be:

- **PROXI SYNESIS**– A standard for connecting APIs and Applications together through a consistent protocol allowing for infinite connectivity between future components (assuming context).
- **PROXI EMPORI**– A supply chain network fully integrated and designed for managing assets and services involved for a standardizing the global supply chain. This would form a basis of protocols and ledgers to provide a decentralized and fully distributed supply chain ecosystem.
- **PROXI NUMIS**– A payment network system designed from the ground up to service a ‘micro-banking &amp; personal credit’ approach to financial instruments and monetary transfer. Micro-banking is a completely novel way of envisioning the economy of growth made possible with the transition to \*Economy 4.0 – \*more will be discussed on this.
- **PROXI ETHOS –** An identity and credential system designed to provide convenience and security bundled into a single service. The use of zero-knowledge proofs and integrated and robust keychain system will combine to provide an expandable yet secure means of identifying and establishing trust.
- **PROXI CHAOS** – A highly distributed and available storage network layer designed to provide an ephemeral storage system that can be accessed through any part of the network. It is ephemeral in the sense that unused data will eventually be overwritten (time-locked system).
- **PROXI LEX** – A standard classification system that will provide a single source of references and definitions and classifications.
- **PROXI NOMOS** – A contract layer which will facilitate the creation and execution of contracts and will provide a trusted layer that can be utilized as a medium of arbitration.
- **PROXI CRONOS** – A time control standardization and layer to ensure that all operation within the network are fully synchronized across the network despite the distributed nature and possible network problems. It aims to keep the everything in sync both on Earth and in Space.
- **PROXI PSIPHOS** – A voting platform designed to ensure smooth and secure voting operations. This will help provide a strong basis of change management which will complement the Nomos contract layer. This can be utilized for anything which requires a voting construct and will provide all manner of customizability for all situations.
