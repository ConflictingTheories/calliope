# A better social network
~ 2020-05-03T03:06:14+00:00 ~

I want a better social network – one that provides me with a satisfaction beyond just the consumption of feeds and likes. I want something to satisfy my inner creator and sadly our current social networks have created what can be at the best of terms ‘influencers’ and frankly in a lot of ways ‘sellouts’ and ‘shills’ are more a propos. The best we can hope for is an artist friend posting some of their creations in a digital format, but the platforms leave little in the way to actually create within them.

Instagram turns people into either product pushers, sex objects, or one of the million ‘photographers’ and actual models (non sex object ones) that proliferate the platform. I myself use it as a catalogue of photos I find aesthetically or personally interesting so it is just a photo album for the most part that I don’t really post in order to share with moreso it provides me photo storage space. But for a lot of people, it is important – the same goes for Facebook, Snapchat, the new one Tik Tok, and cannot forget YouTube.

I mean they are okay at what they do – they are some of the best ad platforms out there. They seep into every aspect of our lives so I am not saying they aren’t successful – obviously they are. People are glued to their social media platforms, and they are slowly forming a personality complex with their digital selves – so something about these platforms is designed to work with human desire – so what gives? Why am I asking for more.

The obvious answer would be that they are bad for our mental health and that they have distanced us whilst promoting connectivity. Perhaps it is because we have sold our secrets and likes and dislikes through to advertisers and now we are plagued by ads and feeds which are curated by bots and algorithms designed to tailor the experience just for us. But neither of those are the reasons – though both are certainly good ones and other people are justified in following for those purposes. My reasons are that I find social media extremely boring and tedious these days – plain and simple I want more entertainment and value from my social platforms.

I want something akin to Minecraft meets Eve meets WoW meets Habbo Hotel meets Facebook meets YouTube and Twitch and Discord meets Cryptocurrencies meets Steam. A meeting of the minds of the greatest components of each element of our digital experiences and abstracting out elements to form a new type of entertainment sphere. One where gaming meets every day social life sharing and a place of artistic expression.

Second Life was last generations attempt of such a place, and whilst I applaud their efforts – I have something a little bit different in mind but something I think would be popular amongst all ages. My attempt is to make it NOT A GAME because that will turn away some people who aren’t gamers. At the same time I want to allow gamers to benefit from game elements without forcing them onto anyone. I also do not want to tack on shallow and poorly thought out mechanics just to appear like I have gaming included.

Some of you may be able to see where I am heading and what my concept is. Others may not be certain how I plan on slamming a dozen different platforms and technologies together. I will draft a bit more of my concept up for you so you can see what I am thinking about, but that will not be now.

I will explain my concept in another article in more detail. I will have to come up with a name, but the focus would be on merging the physical social world we have around us with a creative digital world we could explore and share that expands beyond our physical limitations.

Until next time – take care and thanks for reading!
