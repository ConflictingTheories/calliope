# More Random!

We need more randomness in our lives. Too many things are being curated for us and while this is good in that we typically do get to see someone’s opinion of good – we do not get to experience the novelty of chaos.

Take for example Netflix – It took them YEARS to figure out to add a random episode feature to their offering (and then only on some devices…)

I cannot believe it was not requested by anybody, nor do I believe for a second it was not doable / feasible / etc…. its either ignorance or apathy.

Take for example [Streama](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama) – which is a self-hosted streaming platform alternative to Netflix – it too does not have any random features…. WHY!?

I decided this morning to fix that. I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/pull/1014) to add randomisation to the Streama platform because we deserve to NOT HAVE TO MAKE EVERY SINGLE DECISION!

Thanks.
