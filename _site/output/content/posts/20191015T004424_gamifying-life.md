# Gamifying Life

There is something to be said about the ubiquity of game concepts throughout all manner of human endeavours. Whether it be with accolades, unlockables, limited editions, or skins and themes, gamifying is being found in all manner of applications but also we are seeing it change the way people manage other aspects of their lives.

Most frequently people think of these concepts as being mainly focused on games themselves, but more and more companies are finding different ways of engaging their customers through novel reuses of these popular game mechanics.

 The simplest example is with how news, forums and social media have been utilising this concept of voting or liking a post – a simple action generating a type of point which the OP can then collect and show off. These points typically unlock additional features such as preference, reputation, or premium positions like at the top of the rankings or in some places it can provide a title or badge.

Additionally, more and more productivity apps are building feedback systems that are heavily influenced on how we react to these mechanisms. Some are using trophies, others are providing points. Some are going so far as to make it very much like an RPG.

I wonder if we can somehow one day – have work that appears wholly like a game. People enticed through gamified systems to gather points by performing their duties, going to meetings, and finishing their weekly reports. I am sure we will see more of these game mechanics in our everyday lives in places previously absent of them.

I envision this happening soon – 3-5 years before we see it start to permeate more and more facets of our lives, and within 10 years – I envision almost everything having some form of gamification implemented.

#### Additional Mention &amp; Thoughts

One such idea I have for such a system – is an Augmented Reality Game (ARG) that people interact with directly as both producers and consumers. Rather than having a centralised plot or story that users follow and act out, the ARG would instead provide mechanisms for different users to generate content and provide accolades within the system that can be wholly customised. Kind of how YouTube is driven by user content – I wish to see an ARG based on a such an idea – ARMMOG (Augmented Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Game)
