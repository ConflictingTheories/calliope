# Extelligence and a Cybernetic world

According to Wikipedia, **Extelligence** is a term coined by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in their 1997 book Figments of Reality. They define it as the cultural capital that is available to us in the form of external media (e.g. tribal legends, folklore, nursery rhymes, books, videotapes, CD-ROMs, etc.) Their idea of extelligence made me think about how much more applicable this is in today’s world – a hyper-connected internet-powered one.

A similar thought crossed my mind in regards to Elon Musk’s comment on Joe Rogan’s podcast on how companies can be categorised as **Cybernetic Organisms** in the sense that they are typically a connected mass of technology and biology working in synchronicity. This is in my opinion an extension of the extelligence concept applied to the next level.

As we get more and more connected through internet powered platforms and large distributed networks spread across the globe we will begin to develop a new form of extelligence. This extelligence will be based on the new connections and the new faculties and combinations made available. Whereas for the last couple thousand years physical mediums provided the transference and access to knowledge, but in our future it looks like more and more knowledge will be stored electronically and so too our interfaces with it.

I think to sum up this thought I will leave you with a musing I had while writing this article – If we are building our extelligence through larger and larger networks, when will the network be vast enough to develop its own intelligence to no longer need ours?
