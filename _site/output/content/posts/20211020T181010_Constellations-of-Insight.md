# Constellations of Insight

I recently was watching a very [unique channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnFfi0d9wtw&list=PLgTDUbxeD5zJPMPLjiL4GWglUWYLmUZTm&index=5) and it was probably the most interesting video series I have watched in over a decade. The premise is completely insane, the ideas are laughable, but the series is jaw dropping in all the elements he brings together. In addition, he finds a lot of new information which I cannot find anywhere else - so koodos to this gentleman for his contribution to mankind.

I think one of the coolest things was learning that Stonehenge has a full starmap around it, not just the stones. No one else seems to be aware except this gentleman and his viewers (though I found one reference mentioning such a phenomenon, but no such photos) - at least when I did a quick search I wasn't able to find any mention of orion, and taurus

I have gone onto Google Earth to show it better, at is is hard to spot if you dont know how to orient it.

Maybe give the channel a look (must have an open mind, and don't take things too seriously otherwise, please don't bother - you will be upset) Cheers!
