# 100 lbs Challenge
~ 2020-04-23T03:06:14+00:00 ~

I have decided to challenge myself to lose 100 lbs – not body weight btw! No, instead I have decided to lose 100 lbs of stuff. That includes garbage, recycling, donating, selling or gifting. If you can give it to someone who can benefit that is ultimately the best option, otherwise you can work backwards in the list in order of suggestion.

The purpose of this is to remove stuff you honestly aren’t using anymore and probably will not hurt to lose. For me, its about clearing up unnecessary burdens for stuff which has a purpose that goes unfulfilled is antithetical to its existence and morally reprehensible – so I always feel bad when I see stuff sit on my shelves that I haven’t used.

Especially with technology as it ages more quickly than books, it is important to get rid of any technology you do not wish to collect or use because the sooner you can get rid of those pieces, the more life they have left to live with someone else.

So I challenge anyone who feels they have too much stuff to try and shed 100 lbs of it. You will be surprised how easy that can be for some of us.
