# Data-verse : Realms of Data
~ 2018-10-15T00:24:51+00:00 ~

I believe that data in its truest form occupies (for lack of a better word) space. In this space, it intersects various planes of existence or parameters of measure. These parameters are how we map this data into various forms that we understand. Some of these parameters are conjoined and are meaningless without the others, but some are merely incidental and can sometimes remain eclipsed for quite some time.

I hope to one day find a universal translation between the data-verseâ€™s many forms, so that I can rapidly see all the different ways in which something can be interpreted without having to first interpret it myself.
