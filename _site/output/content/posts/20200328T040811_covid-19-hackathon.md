# Covid-19 Hackathon
~ 2020-03-28T04:08:11+00:00 ~

[\#BuildforCovid](#BuildforCovid) is a movement that is focused on rapidly building solutions to the Covid-19 pandemic. I have decided to help by signing up for the [Covid Global Hackathon](https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/) to throw some ideas into the ring and see if they may help.

My idea at this time is called [CovidQuest](https://devpost.com/software/covidquest) and it is a cross-over between an MMO and real-life questing game. The quests are designed to help the community – that may be delivering supplies, helping a struggling local business, or even just keeping you distance from others.

It is designed to be a social community focused around digital quests and avatars. Each user will have an avatar which they can associate with their account. It will have some customisation options and there will be stats and rewards which they can earn.

Let’s see what I can manage this weekend (only have 2 days left!).

Follow along on the [GitHub Repo ](https://github.com/ConflictingTheories/CovidQuest)as well, and if you want to join – send me a message.
