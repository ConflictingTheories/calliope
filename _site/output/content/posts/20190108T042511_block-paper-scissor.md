Last week, I mentioned how I was looking to get into ethereum a bit and play around and see what I could do. After a week a playing around in my spare time I have succeeded in developing a simple blockchain based android game.

The game is Block Paper Scissors, and as I have only spent a little time on it, it is far from polished, nay in its current form, it is hardly a game. But it runs on the blockchain and there is an underlying game mechanic to it. So, I’m calling it a game.

While I haven’t published anything, I did enjoy making it, and I plan on continuing to work on it over the next week until hopefully it is polished. I may even consider moving up in the world of games and try my hand at something harder –&gt; Chess.

Anyways – here are some screenshots for you. Additionally, if you are interested in how I made the game – I have decided to write up an article outlining my foray into the blockchain world. It is not yet complete, but you can see it [here.](https://kyledm.ca/ethereum-going-for-a-dive/)
