# ConflictingTheories : My New  Channel
~ 2020-07-18T17:26:58+00:00 ~

I have been playing around with Twitch the last couple of days, and I have to say I am enjoying the process so far. It is more than just screensharing which is what I believed for a long time (as I do not follow many streams) but now that I have begun to explore the different softwares, and the creative side of the process – I am getting hooked.

It has given me a whole new love of my old video games because now I have a reason to play them again – I can share them with others (even if nobody watches). Also – it is giving me more experience working with video software which I played around with quite a bit in highschool, but not since so I am very rusty.

My favourite part of the process so far has been creating the layouts and overlays which make up the stream “Scenes”. These are the various screens, inputs, and other media such as videos, gifs, and images. It is very fun building up scenes, finding plugins, applying a bunch of effects and seeing the end result. It really gives you an opportunity to brand your streams and provide a unique experience (and a fun one for the creator).

I am definitely noticing there are lots of features I have yet to touch or explore, but that is to be expected with less than 40 hours of streaming under my belt. I plan on pulling some extra shifts and getting that number up quite quickly and expect to see big changes in my channel over the coming weeks as I refine and explore this new hobby.

I will start to add clips to this site so that I can share my highlights, and will also be setting up a YouTube Channel accordingly. Please check it out as well!
