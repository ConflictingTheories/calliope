# 2021 - Totalitarian Rising
~ 2021-01-02T11:22:00+06:00 ~

It seems to me that we are approaching a point of inflection within our daily lives. Over the course the last year we have been slowly conditioned to become more fearful and slightly more in favour of massive government support. The belief in individuals is at an all-time low.

Rarely do people seem to suggest that we can affect change without the need to enforce it through local or federal regulations and by-laws. Over the last few years has been a growing problem - the problem is not a partisan issue. It is not associated with any particular parties in any particular countries - in fact this problem is found in almost all people who are connected via the internet. This mentality seems to have accelerated over the last decade.

People are tryiing to broadcast their opinions into laws. This has become a global pandemic that has spread to every country - democratic or not. Those who have democracy are now slowly feeding it away through the mechanism that originally propelled it. We have begun to depend on democracy and big government for everyday life. What used to be small local issues and sometimes even personal problems have now become federal, state/province, and municipal purview. What happened? When did this begin? I think its happened with the evolution of social media once it reached network effects.

My theory is that once we were connected to people who we really did not have any business of influencing, we started to get all the side effects - we also began to get affected by others who had no business in influenncing our lives. Those of us who tried to avoid these influences found ourselves still being at their mercy because we cannot avoid those influences once they becomme laws. The legal systems of planet are slowlyl converging around consensus over difference.

Soon there will be no place in the world where you can escape to. Soon, citizenship will be less in terms of values and more in terms of ownership - which jurisdiction is responsible for ensuring your being compliant?

No longer will rights and privileges be a thing - we will soon all be assets for the global product. Because we will cease to be seen as persons and will now be restricted to just pieces of the larger network, and those pieces which do not conform will be removed, and since there will be no place for them to go as the whole system will be one - they must be removed completely from the system.

Laws are being passed as we sit here in our lockdowns that are being used to ensure there is no place you can run that their jurisdictions cannot follow you. Cryptocurrencies who have privacy are being targetted, they are coming for self-hosted wallets, and now with the health laws being passed - they are coming for your person. You will be locked up and you will be forced to do as they say. How is this not what they did to the Jews? They labelled them by their religion is that the differene? SO now Sick People are the Jews of the Nazis. 

I hope this isn't what it looks like. Legalized concetration camps and segration. New York first....whose next?
