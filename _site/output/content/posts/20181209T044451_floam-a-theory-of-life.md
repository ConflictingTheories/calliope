# Floam &#8211; A theory of life
~ 2018-12-09T04:44:51+00:00 ~

Earlier this year, I conceptualised an idea which I felt at the time was a very fitting model for a lot of lifeâ€™s complexities. It is based on the fun craft / toy called floam.

The theory is this. Life comes and goes and at all times things are interacting. As things come together their interactions affect the state of affairs and of the whole unit. Somethings stay together and other things fall apart.

As the system changes, it remains a whole system, but the structure is forever evolving and is never the same. So remember, when life seems to be changing and things appear to fall apart, keep calm and floam on.
