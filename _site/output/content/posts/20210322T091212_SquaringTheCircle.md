# Squaring the Circle - My Approximate Method
~ 2021-03-22T09:13:51+00:00 ~

I have come up with a pretty accurate approximation of Squaring the Circle. I think its a unique method as I cannot find any reference to this scheme for doing so. 

I think it is much more aesthetically pleasing, and is symetrical in its process as well as its result. Its unique in that the square that is generated is positioned directly centred on the circle.

The Method is quite simple and is comprised of about 6 unique steps and then some repition.

It only depends on a compass and straightedge.

My method is as follows:

1. draw straight line.

2. Draw circle with Radius R centred on line

3. Bisect circle and define 4 points at 90 degrees. Where bisection and original baseline. Inscribed a square. (A,B,C,D)

4. Starting at leftmost point of the square (A) - Draw an arc crossing the circumference of the of radius P counter clockwise. at this point (E) again draw and arc and cross over the circumference going counter clockwise around the circle - this is Point (F)

5. Draw a line between the starting corner of the inscribed square(A), to the first point on the circumference(E). Bisect this line with the centre of the circle. Find the point which intersects the circumference.(G)

6. The first edge of the Square of the Circle is formed between the intersection bisection line on the circumference (G) and the second point from the inscribed square (B). Draw a straight line connecting these and extend out.

7. Now rotate and repeat the steps from the next corner of the inscribed square (B) continuing counter clockwise. This will form your square of equal area to the circle once all the lines are finished. The next edge is F and C fyi

If you have R = P you will not have Pi, you will resolve to $3R^2$. P is a trancendental number that is a relationship between Pi and Sqrt(2).
