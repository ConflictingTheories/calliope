# Enough is Enough

Enough is enough. I cannot support these platforms and their monopolistic and idealogical crusades any more. Apple, Amazon, Google, Twitter, Facebook launched a massive censorship campaign starting in the fall slowly building and over the last few days it has accelerated beyond a point of impunity. 

We are watching comedians, politicians, individuals, protestors, and all manner of folks being censored, shut-down, demonetized, deplatformed, having their servers shutdown, and soon I wont be surprised when the DNS censorship begins.

Its insane and we need to stop supporting these tyants any longer. Let them drown. Let them starve. I will not give them my money - I have begun my exodus from them. It started back in 2020 when I got of Amazon, but now I need to remove myself from Facebook, and Google (the hardest of all).

I have begun the arduous transition - but it will be a glorious victory once complete. Knowing that I have severed myself from these dictators will be the first step to fighting back.
