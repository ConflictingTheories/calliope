# The Problem with Meetings

I am sure that you have at some point suffered through a terrible meeting – unless you have been living under a rock and have never had human interaction within a workplace – it is almost inevitable that such an event has occurred in your lifetime.

Why are meetings such a pain? I believe it can be distilled into 3 core *raisons d’etre*.

1. Poor Planning
2. Too Many / Too Few Participants
3. Poor Tools

Poor Planning
-------------

Obviously this is a given – We can argue how to better plan a meeting until the cows come home because frankly, everyone has a different opinion and each comes with a thousand individual caveats. It is easy to say, you need to plan your meetings better and follow this up with a pat on the back, but more than likely, you will continue to have sub-par meetings.

A few key tips, albeit not exhaustive, to improve meeting efficiency are:

- Always have an Agenda!
  - Seriously – Do this! Don’t skip it, and preferably do it first thing when you are scheduling the meeting.
  - This keeps everyone on page and helps fix Problem #2 (we’ll get there shortly)
- Keep your meeting time-boxed!
  - Have a hard time limit. Do not make excuses for extending it – except for extreme cases.
  - Finishing early is okay, but don’t shortcut the meeting to get out quickly – use every minute if necessary.
- Pick a Leader!
  - This person is ideally the organizer of the meeting, but in some cases it may be someone else. They should be focused on opening and closing the meeting as well as directing the discussion.
  - Think of them as a chairperson if that helps.
- Prepare your Notes / Documentation!
  - If you are expected to showcase something or give a presentation, make sure you have it prepared in advance.
  - Also, send out the presentation ahead-of-time digitally, or a print a couple copies to pass around so everyone can stay focused and follow along.
- Decide if it is necessary!
  - Do you actually need this meeting, or can you skip it and get the output from an email?

Too Many / Too Few Participants
-------------------------------

There is nothing worse than going to a meeting and not saying a word. Except perhaps going to a meeting and not getting an answer because the person who has the answer wasn’t invited. This brings me to the second area of my discussion, people.

Having the right people in a meeting is of the utmost importance – too many and you are wasting valuable resources for no reason – when thinking about meetings you have to consider the fiscal cost in both money and time. Rather than thinking about empirical time (1 hour long / etc), begin thinking about your meetings in **Man-hours.**

*Ex. 10 people at a 30 minute meeting is 5 Man-Hours – not 0.5 hours.*

But the real trick is figuring out the right people for the meeting. Namely, who NEEDS to be there, and who DOESN’T. Some questions to think about that may help with this are:

- Is this person a key stakeholder?
  - Is this person going to **make** **a decision** or do they only need to **know the outcome?**
- Does this person have information that will be required? 
  - Does it need to be **presented by them** or just **prepared by them?**
- Does this person have more important obligations or responsibilities than this meeting?

Poor Tools
----------

This is the final problem I see in meetings, there are just no good tools for them. A million different platforms exist for hosting meetings but they never seem to include some of the fundamental components of good meeting hygiene:

- Meeting Minutes / Recordings
  - An easy way to record the notes from the meeting without requiring additional effort or manpower.
- Mailing Lists
  - A way to send non-participants the results of the meetings without having to manage the redactions, tailor each message, and put undue effort into the process.
- Actionables
  - A clearly defined list of outcomes, expectations, and action items that occur during the meeting.

This last part is one that rings close to my heart, and I have decided to help fix this problem. I am in the middle of devising a new tool which should helpfully get this problem sorted once-and-for-all. Stay tuned for the exciting announcement.

Thanks for your time, and I hope you have more efficient meetings in your future!
