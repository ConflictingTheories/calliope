# Website Transitioning
~ 2020-06-05T05:26:55+00:00 ~

I am in the middle of transitioning the website &amp; updating some of the content. I have transferred most of the changes, but in the process I forgot to transfer the media images from the previous site. Luckily I have everything backed up, but I need to spend some time to go through and re-upload and attach the photos. In the meantime I apologise for the state of the website. It will be resolved quickly.

I have also started to build up two more websites:

[Proxi Network – A project of Mine](https://proxi.network)

[Maple Tree Labs – My Freelancing Services ](https://mapletreelabs.ca)
