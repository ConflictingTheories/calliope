# NERD &#8211; SPA Starter Template
~ 2020-09-13T02:03:05+00:00 ~

Having been performing a large number of interviews, I have come to recognize that in this industry (programming / software development) almost every employer wants to confirm technical abilities through a pre-determined challenge.

Some employers do a combination of technical questions, others do theory based questions or trivia, and some do programming puzzles. But more and more seem to be opting for a Take-home challenge. These are typically a bit longer in size and effort, but they afford you the freedom to do them on your own as well.

Having been now tasked with 4 such challenges (and likely more to come if I do not take an offer quick) I have decided to make templates from now on. The hope is that they can help me and others when it comes to bootstrapping projects.

This brings me to the creation of NERD (NginX, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Docker) which is a starter template designed to help with this particular stack. It contains essentially a turn-key implementation with very little but the bare bones of an SPA such that it can be quickly initialized and used as a foundation for new projects.
