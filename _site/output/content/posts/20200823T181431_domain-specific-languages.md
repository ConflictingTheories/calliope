# Domain Specific Languages

Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are useful for so many application that I really feel the concept should be taught more readily across disciplines and within basic grade-school curriculum. They come up so often that they could probably form at least their own class if not a few on various applications both through study and analysis of the popular ones as well as more creative and engineering driven classes with more applied outputs in the development of one’s own.

Domain Specific Languages are languages which are developed under a presumed context. Without the context the languages are sometimes completely useless whilst other times they can be misinterpreted for something else.

This may sound like a huge drawback but the value comes from the assumption that you will be working within a defined context – and frankly that is not a difficult task when you are just trying to solve a task you perform readily and frequently.

Almost any somewhat complex task can be used to model a DSL and that is why they are so powerful – they are very flexible. They are not necessarily transferable however, so keep that in mind when developing one. There is a big difference between a highly generalized and abstracted language from a context-driven DSL.

#### Applications : Graphs &amp; Datasets

One of the biggest uses and rightly so is in the area of graphs or more generally speaking just datasets. DSLs provide the analyst or developer to quickly and concisely work within a dataset or graph and perform lots of relationships, operations, processes and more through the use of a well-tailored DSL.

Now, sometimes its more work than its worth if the problem is small and you are unlikely to repeat that particular set of operations again, but for routine and structured operations or data – DSLs can prove to be a valuable tool at your disposal.

Example:

    *Flow Chart*

    - A –> B –> C –> D
    - B –> D
    - C –> A

This above example is extremely basic, but it illustrates the concept. We have a simple and effect language tool at our disposal that allows us to encode graphs into a simple to read and interpret language. This can be later optimized and analysed by software and various algorithms which can then construct and operate within our graph.

Again – if we only had to work within one graph or predefined network – it may be a bit overkill to develop an engine to interpret and work within our graph DSL, but if we are building a graphing company and will be developing graphing software – then the option becomes more appealing.

#### Difficult Problems

Another area I like to apply DSLs is when approaching a difficult problem which I haven’t seen before. By structuring a DSL as I go through the problem, I am better able to manipulate the pieces of data and the concept typically becomes clearer to me.

This then also provides me with a useful tool for approaching the problems in the future, and if it turns out to be extremely useful I may just incorporate it into other projects in the future. These DSLs do not always have to be purely language driven in the traditional alphabetical sense, but when working on a new problem you can find short-hand notations and sometimes drawings to better capture a concept and help you wrap your mind around it. I have found these sorts of DSLs to be useful in complex processes or understanding reactions or interactions.

Some examples would include *Network Diagrams* or *State Diagrams* and even though they have the word diagram within their name – they are not much different from DSL’s and in fact can readily be translated to a written form. They provide concise and intuitive means to analyse a scenario and process and can be much better than long paragraphs or even architectural drawings in some cases.

So, if you take away anything from this post – make it this: use and work with domain specific languages (DSLs) and start looking out for them. When you start to see them in various places you will begin to appreciate their prevalence and their usefulness. Even chinese food restaurants have found that having key-codes in front of their menu items is a useful DSL to help fix any translation problems that may arise.
