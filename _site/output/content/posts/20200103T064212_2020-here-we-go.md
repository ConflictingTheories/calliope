# 2020! Here we go
~ 2020-01-03T06:42:12+00:00 ~

Now that we have officially kicked off the new year, it is time for some of us to start new ambitions and so-called ‘resolutions’. I never have once felt resolved towards a new year’s resolution, so the whole new years thing is not a make-or-break ordeal for me however I do enjoy using moments like these to help spur insight.

Lately, I have begun to count the months in weeks rather than days and I find that worrying. My biggest resolution for this year – to take it in stride and soak it in. I really want to ensure that I enjoy this year, embrace it as much as I can, and savour every moment of it that comes to pass. I don’t want to passively sit back and watch it go by like an observer – I plan on being a participant.

Rather than focus so much on what I plan on doing from the get-go, I usually prefer to look back and reflect on the year gone by and analyse it for information. Perhaps this post should be called ‘2019! So long’, but forget-about-it, what’s done is done. I choose to reflect on the year because they each go by so quickly and I feel like I don’t take enough time to enjoy them as they go by.

So what about 2019? Well, 2019 was a year with a lot of changes for me. I moved into a new place downtown; I took on greater responsibilities at work and became more involved with the business; I had a vacation to San Francisco in the summer with my Mum and Sister; and I got slightly more involved with my own passion-projects and hobbies. I started to build my financial stability again and pulled myself out of debt (excepting student loans).

2019 was not all good though – it was a year of a lot of sober realisations. I had a realisation that I am going to be slipping farther and farther from my university friends as I get older no matter how close we were. I had a realisation that from this point on, I am the only person who can truly affect change in my life – in the past I was much more dependent on other factors or people, but not anymore. I also realised that I need to continue develop new friendships, but that like all friendships – they build around something. I finally realised, that I still have a long way to go in terms of personal and professional development.

On a personal side – I need to command more control of my inner dialogs and similarly learn to master control over my outer dialogs. I need to stop working on autopilot and become more cognisant of its presence – it is something I hadn’t realised I was doing until recently – but I go onto auto-pilot pretty badly (tbh a lot of this article is autopilot).

On a professional side – I need to learn to better delegate tasks and to engage my team and clients in different ways by adapting to them rather than trying to have them adjust to my ways. I also need to become comfortable not having an answer – I need to discover a few more of my inner voices that I rarely call on.

I think that with the lesson’s I have learned from 2019 – I will be able to approach 2020 with the right approach. Here’s to a successful new year!
