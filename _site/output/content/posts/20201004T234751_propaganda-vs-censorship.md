I would rather live in a world filled with propaganda than one censored of fake or other news &amp; unsavoury opinions. I would rather feel offended everyday by people’s statements, beliefs, values, and political affiliations than one which everyone is censored of their true feelings, told what or how to speak, and shutdown, removed and censored.

I am not talking about certain egregious materials that do deserve such ends no less than utter destruction and abolishment – there are some I would put on a list and state proudly I am no hypocrite in doing so – I am morally just and rational and if anyone so disagrees I would question immediately their values – and likely would find them completely unrecognizable to mine and thus such people are not worth the effort, time, or thought of debating – unless you know a way to certainly change a person’s values – its pointless. Are they less human – no, but I certainly am not beholden to hold all humans in the same regard or even choose to dignify their existence except to perhaps separate myself as to what I strive to not be or become.

People get offended by ideas – these should be spread, discussed, debated and fought in open forum – there is no idea that can be horrid enough to be worth destroying, but that being said – not all ideas again are meritable, or deserve one’s efforts, time, or thought. Ideas are not the same as heresay, gossip, or graphic materials – they are frequently defended as such – and this is where I draw my line. They are not the same. Freedom to spread ideas should be protected and promoted and championed by all – but the freedom to spread gossip, heresay, and graphic materials should not be protected under the same such lines.

An idea holds original thought – something which can be ‘added’ to ones psyche and minds awareness – whereas gossip, heresay, shock and other such materials are not designed to create original thought that can be added – but is instead designed to violently ‘expand’ ones thoughts. Many claim such material if not protected under ideas, should be protected under some weird form of thought expansion and learning endeavor – but they fail to recognize that while materials do provide ‘expansion’ of the mind, they should never ‘burst’ as such extreme material is designed to do. Elasticity of the mind is exactly that – elastic to a point – and like a rubber band can snap if stretched too rapidly. Thus shocking materials should be seen as damaging materials which could ruptures ones learning capacities for good – just as damagingly loud sounds are not allowed in public places.

Thus ideas should never burst – they should always be growth driven – never destructive in nature. Thus – censorship falls into the same such problems that it professes to protect against – it is a destructive act – though its means are different. Censorship erases while extremism explodes. Both are horrible actions and should be abhorred, but in the end – we can always choose to apply more clothes and likewise can choose to self-filter (provided we have the tools to do so – that’s another argument though) – but we can never know what has been filtered from us – and whether or not it was because it was destructive extremist filth or growth which may otherwise be seen as a threat by someone else in power.

I think the true test of whether an idea is dangerous is whether is calls for a destructive action. If it does – we should ask ourselves is that truly necessary – or can we achieve a better outcome by adding something new rather than censoring or blowing up. We should be practicing lateral thinking puzzles more and more these days – because we are not in a straightforward story – our narratives are always limited-knowledge games. We shouldn’t remove the idea – because that only works when you are in power – if you aren’t in power than your chances of going that route are less effective – which suggests that authoritarian states would benefit in the long run.

Sadly – today we live in a world which is more and more an authoritarian state every single day. I bet people reading this have been biased this entire article and have been picturing various ‘news’ stories, and scandals that they personally feel some emotion about and are aligning my words as either support of their views or further evidence against the views of their ‘enemies’. Or they see this as some misinformed person who just ‘doesn’t understand’. Opinions we see are being censored under the guise of protecting people from extremism or propaganda – we have journalists like Julian Assange being run through a farce of a justice system for exposing human rights violations just so he himself can be a victim of appalling failure of justice and have his essential human dignity vacuumed away from him to protect foreign interest groups and globalists – its disgusting.

Then you have US court systems which take years and years to decide whether or not massive NSA spying operations are constitutional…when no one said they were or even realistically thought for a moment that they were…but Snowden is still on the lam for protecting his countrymen and fellow citizens – let alone many westerners from allied countries who were also being spied upon. Two heroes both called traitors and barred from having a civilized and decent life. Its terrible – what an atrocious display of ethics.
