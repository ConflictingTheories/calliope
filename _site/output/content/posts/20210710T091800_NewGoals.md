# New Goals
~ 2021-07-10T09:18:51+00:00 ~


So I have decided to set myself some new goals. I have been feeling a bit unchallenged in terms of programming lately, and I think it is primarily because I slowed down in my learning of new stuff (_which is never a good thing!_). To fix this problem I have decided to set myself some new goals.

### Goals - New Languages / New Paradigms

One of my favourite things about programming, is that different language provide their own paradigms. Some enforce particular idioms while others focus on flexibility and each have their trades offs. I find the best course is to get familiar with the paradigm which the language uses and then from that perspective, use it to solve problems, rather than finding problems to mangle into a new paradigm.

While I myself fight with this frequently and typically attempt to shoehorn into something familiar rather than explore the new and dangerous world of the unknown, so its time to fix that.

I have setup the following goals for myself:

- Learn **Rust**
- Learn **Julia**
- Revisit Graphics more in-depth (OpenGL subset variant -- Probably WebGL)
- Get familiar with Distributed / Decentralized networks
- Review the CCNA materials

---

These are each quite satisfying goals, but as one can probably tell, each are but the first step on their own respective journeys. This can be a lot of work, so what I tend to do is to mix and match effort to try and combine new things so that I do not have to find twice as much time to learn. Namely - just like companies form Joint Ventures (JV) - I like JV style projects for education.

I have decided that to mix Graphics into Rust will be quite straightforward, and because of Rust's Wasm support - I will be focusing on generating cross-platform modules and libraries that I can use in other places. This will eventually be brough back around to something like React Native modules or something like that if possible.

I will also see if this is perhaps a good outlet for some small projects which I have been wanting to address, but have continued to deprioritize due to their slight paradigm differences from my recent projects. This I hope will expand my understanding and boost my creativity. Plus I am bullish on these paths as far as careers go, and I know that if I combine these skills I will be very valuable alongside my existing skillset.
