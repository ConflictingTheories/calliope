# Decentralized Gaming

Wouldn't it be cool if we could have a game which ran through decentralized clients, but which shared a common chain of truth. Rather than worry about PoW and traditional mining, we could have a client-driven node which operates by performing txn's on the chain. These txn's change the state of the world (game's universe) and this is translated through a concensus protocol. Rather than having a centralized server managing the state of the world, you could split it out to the clients themselves (which typically do most of the asset/rendering anyways).

The chain could be used to manage the state of the game and over time it could be pruned and adjusted. The key would be finding a happy medium where it would not be too resource intensive to play the game. There would be full-nodes / masternodes which would run the game servers entire state, and there could be some light node clients would be used to play the game without having full access to the chain's entire history.

There could be multiple federated services to help manage the various components of the game, but also to allow for further expansion and modification using the core game's network. There would be options to perform trades and exchange the assets within the game through an auction market, but these assets would also be mined by playing the game and these transactions would be logged on the chain.

The game server would be seeded, but the assets would be fungible and setup in a way to promote a user-centric economy. One which the players (much like in minecraft) would be responsible for acquiring various digital assets, which could in turn be used to build additional assets (non-natural) which could also be traded and used, and this could be licensed and ideally a real in-game and extra-game economy can form from it.
