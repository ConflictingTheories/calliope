# A little bit of my history 
~ 2020-04-15T20:22:00+00:00 ~

Since this is my personal blog, I think it is fair to occasionally take a purely vain look at myself and have posts devoted wholly to some aspect that really only impacts me in the end. That is what this post is all about – a little look into some of my history – really just a tiny slice – less than two whole years of my life.

#### University Graduation &amp; Entrepreneurship

In my last year of university, I like many of my fellow classmates and students across the country, partook in a semester-long capstone project to cap my degree.

I had met the team that I went on to build our capstone through the team leader via email. I had misread the deadlines and was late on meeting some submission requirements which had been necessary to pursue my original plan so I was forced to find an existing team and hope hey had a project which I could support (and find interesting).

The project seemed interesting because it involved predictive modelling, large data-sets, real-time streaming, and had the potential for all sorts of additional goodies. It was an energy forecasting tool which was designed to help alleviate the problem of predicting wind turbine output in advance to help prepare power operators if the need to take action. The project was sponsored by a professor of the university and it looked like the team was well put together.

We had five members and each had a unique set of strengths which made it very well balanced and was probably one of the few times I had a team like that during university.

One member was great with presentations and was very comfortable in front of an audience which immediately put him front and centre for that role – he also enjoyed networking and was happy to do market research for the project as well as business modelling – all of these are a rarity in engineering typically.

The next member on the team was the leader and he had originally been working on the project prior which gave him insight into the motivations and the sponsor (aka the professor). His internal insight helped shape many of the decisions we would make as he would be our client’s barometer.

The third member of the team had an eye for style and user experience. Being that we were building not only a predictive engine – but a sexy one at that – we would need to spice up the delivery of the platform and ensure that it provided a pleasing experience as well as an insightful one.

The fourth member of the team was probably the least experienced of each, but he was diligent and would stick to a problem – he was placed in charge of the predictive model as it would be a difficult problem which would likely never be perfect and require someone who could just keep going at it again and again.

The final member was myself – I was put in charge of the architectural designs, the technological stack, operations, infrastructure and deployment, as well as the specifications and manuals for the system. Essentially, my job was to oversee end-to-end of the tech, choose what would go together, and then package it into a turn-key system which provided the final deliverables that the client would receive.

Since we each understood our roles well – we all took off to the races to design and build this system. Early into the project – the professor had also hinted that if it went well we may be considered for some equity as he was considering commercialising it. This also drove us with some extra oomph because of the potential.

All in all the project went well and we did quite a good job at building the platform. It was missing a nice-to-have feature or two, and the predictive model was a little weak by the time we were done, but everything was there in terms of groundwork and foundation and it was ready to be polished into a commercial product with just some minor adjustments and more importantly some trial customers.

Since our professor had given us the green light to pursue some entrepreneurial options we looked at a whole bunch of pitch competitions and grants we could apply to. We ended up pitching at the New Energy Venture competition and while we didn’t win we were finalists and placed 4th out of 6 contestants. This gave us the motivation to keep running with the momentum and we then used our finalist standings to qualify for a few more meetings with different grants. We finally found our in with an entrepreneurial centre that provided us with approximately $45000 in funding to pursue an business venture that summer.

We enrolled in a few entrepreneurial programs with the funds and gave ourselves a living wage so that we could afford to skip full-time work and drive home the new business venture. Everything was going great – until the professor decided he wanted the IP for himself and that he would not concede on this venture. We were not yet out of luck though. We could still keep the grant as long as we focused on a new venture and tried to find a new business idea instead – so we did.

#### Pivot – Pivot – Pivot – Paper

Having lost our initial opportunity, we were forced to begin the arduous journey of brand new market discovery – unfortunately we didn’t even have an idea to discover with any more as start point.

I don’t know how many entrepreneurs have been in this position, but I am betting it is a lot – while the circumstances may not be exact – the concept of pivoting is almost universal. Every business starts different from what it becomes and this is same for startups if not more prevalent in the early years of a business. Fortunately since there we 5 of us, we were able to spitball a lot of ideas quickly and run them through the ringer pretty quickly as well.

We did weekly scrum meetings where we would have week-long sprints to quickly get feedback and make decisions about next weeks activities. We would decide on an idea – assign tasks such as specific market research, specific interviews, or more general stuff like contacting advisers and getting advice on different aspects in business. Then we would go out and gather as much information as we could – finally at the end of the week everyone was brought back in and we would decompress all that we had gathered.

- Monday : Weekly Scrum Brainstorm / Planning / Assignments
- Tue-Thur : Tasks
- Friday : Weekly Decompress / Debrief / Assessment

We would specifically take a whole day on Monday just to brainstorm because if we could poke holes in an idea it wasn’t worth bringing to others, and if we couldn’t we each saw something different that was of value which we could go validate. Trying to rush through this process was the last thing on our minds – we were looking to “Get out there” unless we knew what we were checking.

The next three days of each week were the meat – we would run through all over the city – meeting people, making calls, checking websites, sending emails – you name we did it. We were constantly trying to get assessments and opinions and distil them. We learned very quickly which ideas were too simple, too complex, and sometimes too useless. We probably went through 2-3 three crap ideas before we even had one we thought about more than one week – the first pivot.

The first pivot was a hiring platform focused on a hybrid between job training and job posting, and candidate screening. Designed to help you certify yourself and then easily interview for jobs and skip parts you have previously certified against. The idea seemed simple, and while definitely no blue ocean, it was a something tangible we could pursue. To give us something to champion behind we decided to come up with a name for the supposed company – but not the platform itself. We decided on a name called “Nimbus Vi” which we never did anything with but specifically chose due to its ambiguity and nothingness – it could be a bank, accounting firm, cloud company, who knows. This way we could possible make some materials that were idea-agnostic and not have to keep changing things or reworking templates.

We quickly got to work and developed a whole slew of questions and metrics that we would use to gain some insight into the crowded space of job-placements &amp; hiring. It wasn’t long before we decided to get out of that space just a quickly. It is a difficult area to tackle. Each industry had some many differences – each company compounded those differences, and in the end it mostly came to culture fit and not skills. It also did almost nothing to alleviate the true pain that the businesses were having – loss of talent, no talent available, and costly talent beyond their budget – the interview process was the side-effect of these problems, but the not the cause of them.

Our next pivot came as we quickly though about a bunch of different Cypto assets and perhaps go the way of an ICO and form a new blockchain based system that facilitated improvements and investment. Unfortunately for us, as we were looking into this there was the massive hack against the DAO on the ethereum network and we quickly shied away from that area. With not much time left on our budget and the end of summer getting closer and closer, we started to get desperate.

We decided maybe we should form an events company which would host large extravagent conferences and showcases built up around technology. We wanted to show off engineers, hackers, gamers, and programmers in a sort of X-Games style of competitions and swag. Events designed to bring more people into the STEM field and show that it is not just boring business, but can be exciting. The idea was to generate a hype like eSports have been getting. Since we had little time we started to just buckle down and accept our fate – we would try to form this events company. So we went to it – it was not a good looking horizon.

Very high capital costs – lots of marketing spend – huge insurance premiums, and that was before you even got to selling the tickets. These events are booked far in advance which would require operating expenses and increased overhead, and the more we looked at it, the harder it was for us to find ways of generating high enough returns. It was possible sure – but it requires the scale and scope of a huge breadth that makes it a risky venture for angel investors to want to get behind. Especially because events usually require some form of recognition before people want to go.

But, we had almost no time so we looked around and decided it was time to incorporate – on of the team knew a lawyer and he said he would help us out for a cheap rate. We scheduled the meeting and met with him one afternoon the next week. That meeting would set the stage for our final pivot – to Paper

Paper – a legal tech platform aimed at facilitating business legals. Our team was now 6 members and we had a new idea to go validate. We ran out, and once again did what we always did – researched, planned, and got market feedback. It came back positive – there were lots of pain points on both sides. Lawyers had pain – Businesses had pain. Hell, accountants had pain. It was beautiful – we could help these people. And thus Paper was born.

June 30, 2016 we incorporated the business and each took equity. We were officially entrepreneurs now.
