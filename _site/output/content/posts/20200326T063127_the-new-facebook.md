I have been going on less and less these days, but I have been checking in for the COVID-19 updates and making sure everything is still how I left it.

Generally, yes Facebook is still the same – except now most people are agreeing about the things they hate for once. Leave it to a virus to make us finally see eye to eye. Anyways – I noticed at the top of my screen a banner inviting me to see the new facebook. Boy is it different. I am not sure how I feel, but here is a screenshot for you.

Right off the bat – everything is bigger – and it feels a lot like LinkedIn in a way but with its own flair.

I do like that they are opting for a dark mode – more websites are doing that these days and I appreciate it – though as a developer I also hate it.

Cheers
