If you go back to last year on this blog, you should be able to find a couple of posts about something called “SpyDays” and I have decided to bring it back this year.

SpyDays, for those of you who do not know, is a team building exercise I created last year to try at work – and it proved rather successful. It did have some bugs in its implementation, so this year I hope to spin it up without some of the problems that showed up in the first round.

In celebration of the first anniversary I have decided to improve it by adding an AR component. In addition to physical clues scattered around the office, I will include some AR clues which will require people to download and use an App.

Luckily, for me, Viro AR comes with a lot of the functionality I have been looking for and a nice and simple RN package. I think that I will also include some of the elements that I hope to include in Espion into SpyDays – interactive in-app puzzles.

I am not sure when I will have the final elements completed, but I hope it is soon, and when I do, I shall surely post about the outcome of this year’s SpyDays competition. So long and thanks for reading.
