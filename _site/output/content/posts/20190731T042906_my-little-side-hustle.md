# My little side hustle

Once upon a time I decided to start a side gig. I had wanted to have one for quite a few years beforehand, but I had constantly been thinking too much and not actually going about and starting it. The first step is to know what you do, and why you do it (or at least why your customers want it). So first and foremost let me tell you about what I do and why I do it.

#### A bit about the business

Obviously what I do is related to my skillsets which happen to be related to technology, but I feel that most of what I have learned should still apply to any sort of business on the side.

I run a tech consultancy on the side. I help design, build, and test software. In this case the project I am currently working on is a cloud app. Without going into specifics it’s a workflow software that bundles activity dashboards with control management and captures and reports on data. The nature of my business requires I take on a limited number of clients as I only do this part time I am still trying to fit in some sort of social life.

#### Starting the business

I knew pretty quickly that I wanted to do something in tech and specifically mt strengths were in software and electrical engineering. I had some experience with the startup life at Athennian I felt I had the necessary combination to launch my side business. It also helped that my full time job is also working at a software consultancy so I hone my skills even when I am not working on it and likewise I get better at my full-time job as well.

Great, but how did I start? Honestly, I’m not going to bullshit you. It took a lot of work (more than I had even consciously put in) to get it started. It wasn’t however made up of any of the following:

- Business cards / brands / logos
- Website / SEO / marketing
- ‘Content’ / Portfolios

It was none of the above. Hell, I still don’t have those things to my liking and some of them are still nonexistent. That wasn’t what made any part of my business. It was a customer. Plain and simple I found a customer. How I got that customer was some might say a fluke, but perhaps circumstantially it was, but it is repeatable and I’m going to tell you how, so maybe it isn’t a fluke. The process is a simple one theoretically, and therefore painful in practice. The process for me was this.

I talked a lot. I constantly talked about great ideas, apps, software, the future, technology, businesses, startups, you name it. I still do to anyone who listens and who appreciates it. I just offered all the free conversations, coffees discussions, meetups and would try to bother people any way I could with meaningful ideas and questions. I wasn’t selling them by the way. I never once would sell them on anything. I would discuss with them and get their minds racing until they inevitably hit upon something they didn’t know what to do with. Some problem they found insurmountable. Usually, since this was my domain, I knew exactly how to solve it, or I knew a process at least they could use to try and find out more. So I told them and heard their feedback.

People teach you a lot. Every day, every interaction can be used to glean information. I enjoy discussing ideas so I made it part of my everyday. This is what led quite a few people to say ‘Do you know how to XYZ?’ from time to time. Again, frequently I did know the process or could devise the solution so again I gave free advice. Not once did I sell my services. If they asked if I knew anyone who could do XYZ for them, I frequently responded – well I can!

This is the easiest way to get potential customers. These people who you constantly talked about your ideas with will one day refer you to someone. That someone may be a paying customer. That’s exactly what happened to me. I had so many people know about my interests and I kept saying I can do these things, that one day I received a referral for someone who wanted to pay. That was it – I was in business.

Starting a business is a beast. Everytime you think you have it under control and things will be easier from now on, its only a matter of time before your world is shifted again beneath you. Getting my first customer felt like a rush, until I thought about the payment structure. Again, I focused on getting my customer long before I did a single other thing. This included a cost breakdown structure, and everything else needed to run a business.

#### Price Politics

In order to sell my services, I needed to know what my services were worth. I spent a good solid weekend thinking over my costs, the time I was going to put in, the level of assurance I was going to give. I was building a consultancy, so I was on a per hour basis. I needed to make sure that I would not take on too much, or promise too much at a price I couldn’t deliver. I also, being new to the game, couldn’t offer the market rates. I’m far from an expert so I have price accordingly. After a solid weekend of math, research, and various models I came up with a cost breakdown structure for the project. Following that I had my hourly wage I had resigned myself to for the remainder of this project.

#### Intentions are clear

Having priced myself, I proceeded to draft up a Letter of Intent and inside of it listed the various stipulations around the project and its general expectations. I attached my detailed estimate and just to be official I decided to brand myself. So I quickly drafted a logo in Paint and slapped it onto my letterhead as a brand. That’s Agile motherfucker ;).

With my letterhead ready and LOI sent off, I felt ready for all that would come. I received the LOI back and proceeded to jump into business. Normally you would have a more formal scope of work, but I knew the customer from previous encounters and felt the LOI was sufficient for this project. After the LOI, I drafted up a project kickoff proposal and sent that off with the general outline of project firmly beneath my beautiful letterhead. It was time to do the thing.

#### Over-organizing

To get started I felt the best way would be to organize everything in Google drive, but I definitely wasn’t going to be organizing my stuff with my personal drive contents. It was there for necessary to get a GSuite Account. Sure, I could have made a regular Gmail account and used it for free, but I wanted to feel a bit more professional and get thing setup for the future. Transitions are hard, so I figure with something’s just start early. But if I was going to go this far, I should register a domain name. So I did, then setup the mail server so I could have a professional email address. Not bad – just a little overhead to get my files organized.

After I had the drive account setup(and branded baby) I was ready to start to prepare my folders. Honestly, you may thinking I have spent a long time talking about folders and Google drive and what not, but the reason is because what you do will lay the groundwork for all that follows. Being cognizant of that will save you much grief in the future. Thing will change, so how can you minimize the pain in the future? Structure and predictability.

If you can engineer structure and predictability into your business, you will have less stress in the future. The key though, is flexibility in all things. Don’t build a system that can’t adapt and is too rigid in its structure. My personal method is categorising and tree structures. It allows me to collapse the tree and relabel, move, snip etc without losing organisation. By tree I mean, don’t have a dumping ground of documents and folders. Everything should be structured all the way through. These folders can always be combined or merged later, and the tree structure is perfect for any size of complexity too.

Even now, a couple of years later I can quickly and easily find what I am looking for. Having a structure is important – it doesn’t have to be my structure, but something that makes sense to you (and anyone else involved). Also, these structures can mutate, and don’t have to remain the same if they aren’t working any more – a good rule of thumb is that with any system, if it degrades can it be quickly repaired, or will it fall into a state of irreparable disarray. I like my method because every once in a while I can do a cursory cleaning and reorganise and restructure. I always have an archive folder – this is used to capture anything I am no longer in pressing need of but cannot afford to remove. I also typically have a miscellaneous folder – I think of this as the junk drawer – a place for things that have no place.

#### Overcoming the obstacles

I would say looking back that there were a lot of obstacles which I was not really expecting to have come up. A lot of them had to do with systematic overhead and general largess that I could not seem to get rid of and still grapple with. In short, I just could not move fast enough or efficient enough and was never at the pace I wanted be moving at. The weeks would fly by and I would find myself having devoted a lot less time than I originally planned and that I was spending a lot of time on organizing and preparing my work to make sure it was accounted for. This was not in my original price / cost analysis.

Another issue I faced was maintaining diligence. Not just because this was a side gig, but because there were a lot of minor setbacks and menial tasks to perform along the way that would drain my resolve. When I got stuck on a problem I had no team to turn to – this gets tiresome after a while – the only benefit is at least you are only fixing your own bugs (minus a package here or there…). I would sometimes rail against the same problem for days on end and having no-one else to provide their input made problem solving a grind and not necessarily a joy. Now, when the problems were solved it was satisfying – but again there was no team to relish the struggle with .

Something else I didn’t see coming. I never thought that sending out invoices would be such dreary work – I mean come on, its money right?! I made a mistake early on and one I wish I had not done – I split my pricing into multiple categories based on the type of work it was. Project management / Client Management / Development / Testing / Design all had different rates – this is silly since I am still proffering my time in all cases equally. What it did was short-change me on some work (obviously anything not the highest rate) but it also required me to account for the categories of relevance. This meant I had to record my time in more detail, I needed to then gather that data every time I needed to draft an invoice. I found by the end that it would take me on average 1-2 hours to draft an invoice which when you are maybe performing 20-40 hours of work per invoice becomes a sizeable issue.

Today, I still have these challenges, but for the most part I have learned to deal with them.

#### Onward

I plan on continuing my side gig for at least the next little while. I enjoy having a bit of extra cash on hand, and I think that the experience pays dividends. It also may provide future opportunities I have yet to come across and for that I am optimistic. All in all – it has been a great experience – very educational and filled with lots of learning and growing and I would recommend to anyone with a passion to turn it into a side-gig.
