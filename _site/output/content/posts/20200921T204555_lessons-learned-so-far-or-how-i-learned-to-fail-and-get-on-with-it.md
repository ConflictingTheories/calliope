Most of my posts over these last couple months have been related to job hunting, and this is no different. Some days you have a lot of thoughts that need to get out and the best way is to rant or write them down. I have done both a couple times today, so I feel like something is up with my mental state or energy. Regardless of that tangential thought, here is another post to whet your appetite for boring derivative ideas:

### Things to Improve…

- Be more concise and to the point in my answers.
- Answer the questions without spending too much time on backstory or context.
- Elaborate more on my experience working within teams and with teams as opposed to my role on the team.
- Avoid repeating ideas more than once or paraphrasing instinctively (unless misunderstood)
- Shed light on my experience working on “multiple-release” products and projects. (Apparently I do a bad job of explaining this)
- \*\*Love\*\* Testing / Strong Typing / Random Modern Syntactic Sugar based on the opinions of the technical interviewer, the chosen framework / language, the specification or version (Jave8+, PHP7+, Typescript 4+, etc…)

### Doing Alright…

Areas that I seem to be doing well on (obviously can probably improve in some way shape or form though):

- Energy – good energy (people like my energy)
- Cover letter – seems to be decently effective
- Technical Knowledge (Generally)

### Sprechen ze english?

Areas that seem opaque to me, and I have no idea if I am doing well or not:

- Cultural Fit / Personality Fit / Humor
- ??? (Do we really know what we don’t know?)
