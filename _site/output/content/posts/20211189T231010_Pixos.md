# Pixos - Retro ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Passion
~ 2021-11-18-T20:10:10+00:00 ~

I have been working on a new plugin for Calliope - this one is based on retro games, and is a continuation on the block concept, but with a more retro-esque feel. I plan on expanding this plugin to allow for custom maps, audio, and some simple scripting to allow for simple diorama style scenes which can be played or interacted with. The idea is to make micro games and almost memetic experiences that are interactive.
