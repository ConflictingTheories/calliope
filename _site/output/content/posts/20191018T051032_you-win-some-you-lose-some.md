# You win some, you lose some

Everyone knows that life comes in waves and sometimes it feels like you are facing insurmountable odds, and other times you get the sensation that life is going better than you could have ever hoped – the ebb &amp; flow of our fortunes, the tides of change.

I feel like things are on a lucky break for me in the last few weeks. Progress is being made, tasks are getting done, new projects are moving and I have had two small actual wins – i’ll explain what I mean.

The last few months prior were kind of rough – not super difficult or anything like that, but just sort of draining, so to finally be reaping some rewards and getting some bonus wins on the side is a good feeling. One I fear I may jinx acknowledging it… but minor superstitions aside, I am feeling good. Now, back to those wins I mentioned – I have won two unexpected contests which I had no intention of participating in prior to the moment. One was a random free bingo night at a local bar where both myself and my buddy won prizes. The second was winning a signed copy of *A Tour of C++: Second Edition* by Bjarne Stroustrup at a talk.

I was already excited about the talk because it was being delivered by Bjarne Stroustrup who was the designer of the C++ programming language. I got to fulfil a small childhood story arc for the first programming book I ever picked up was *The C++ Programming Language: Special Edition* by Bjarne Stroustrup. When I picked it up it was because I had just discovered C++ which was the first language I ever programmed with, but the thing that stuck out to me was his name – to a 13 year old kid it was an interesting name and one that I have never forgotten. So, when I was invited by a friend of mine who works for a company that was hosting an event by him, I knew I had to go and check it out.

The event was small but packed, lots of different people of different backgrounds and ages all attending. It was nice to see some small catering for the guests as it provided a bite to eat and some beer to drink and gave plenty of opportunities to network and meet other guests. The talk was great. It reminded me of being back in university listening to guest lecturers discuss a specific topic – always educational and filled with a level of joviality as can be found all those who are impassioned by their pursuits.

 Bjarne did a great job taking questions from the crowd and gave thoughtful and robust responses. It was nice finally getting to listen to one of the people who have inspired my programming journey in person and get to pick their brain for insights and opinions. I was lucky to get to sit down and have a short discussion with him briefly after the talk one-on-one and ask his opinions on some different topics like futurism and his expectations for different technologies. He discussed some of the various opportunities in so many different industries we have today – space, cars &amp; self-driving vehicles, generators, and more.

After listening to him, and having a chat with him, it is clear that here is a man who values systems and performance – dedicated to harnessing as much power from everything he does, you can tell that efficiencies mean something to him. The way he describes the C++ templating system upgrades in the coming soon C++20 it hard to say he is anything but passionate about the upcoming changes and very much in favour of them. I think I may take a dip in C++20 sometime in the near future and reacquaint myself with the language.

So to wrap it all up, it feels good to have a few small wins every once in a while. You really get a new boost of energy and drive to push onward to bigger and better outcomes. Going through the rough patches is hard, but for most people it is only temporary and there will some future good waiting to spring up eventually. The ebb and flow of our fortunes is just part of the inevitable, so we might as well enjoy the good parts when we can. Anyways, take care and good luck!
