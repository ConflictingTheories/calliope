# Ethereum Tournament Standard
~ 2019-01-03T01:26:12+00:00 ~

I wish to propose an idea for a Tournament standard for the Ethereum blockchain.

The idea is that there should be a standard format for building and running tournaments such that they can be interrelated (one tournament can feed into another – such as placement tournaments) as well as providing a standard means of ranking / managing placement within the tournament.

It would also dictate how the gas will be used to run the tournament such that players are incentivized to join a tournament without worrying about the costs to run the contract through its entirety. In other words, winners shouldn’t have to pay to see if they won.

It should also provide a standard for managing the entrance fees / tournament winnings as well as determining how one deals with a draw / tie.

Since it requires managing the placement on-chain, there needs to an efficient means of updating ranks and determining how a tournament proceeds.

At first, there might not be a huge demand for such a standard, but considering that competition and tournaments have been around for a very long time and are heavily ingrained in our cultures, it only makes sense that they can be a part of this disruptive technology.

I am merely proposing the concept, perhaps I will get around to a more technical proposal should I find the time.

PS. I also feel that there should be a standard for managing “Matches” and ranked games (such as chess or other ELO / FIDE style systems.) where it doesn’t just come from a tournament, but from official games as well.

PPS. In both of these cases, concerns may be raised on ensuring fair play within the tournaments or matches – this again I feel suggests the need for a standard.
