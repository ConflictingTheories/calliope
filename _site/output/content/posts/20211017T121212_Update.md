Its been a while since I made any new posts, and life has been a bit busy the last few months, so I thought I would take some time to make a post and keep things up to date.

Primarily, I have been busy focusing on making the most of the remaining summer while it was here, and since then focusing on getting ready for a productive fall and winter.

I recently decided to register a new company and start making some of my side projects a bit more real. While I am still in the process of setting everything up and getting the business underway, it has been a good process. So far I have been revisiting the laws regarding corporatione registrations, by-laws, articles and governance as well as all the necessary requirements for stocks, banking, shareholders and taxes.

While I don't expect to make much (if any money) for the initial period until I can get some traction, I figure it is better to lay a solid foundation for a company that can scale and grow as opposed to piecing together the necessary compliance later down the road. (Now this may be controversial to some people). I figure if you can get your bearings when it is a smaller and simpler company, it should in theory make everything more cogent when business starts to get serious.

I have always been the kind of person who likes to understand what is happening behind the scenes (even if the magic is ruined), so by performing all the necessary steps myself, I expect to learn more than if I should just hire someone like an accountant and lawyer to help. I can always go down that route when it comes, but until then I would rather consciously focus on the steps (even if some mistakes get made) so that I can truly learn the ropes. This isn't my first business, but it is my first solo-corporation from scratch, so with new ground, comes new opportunities! =]

In other notes, I have decided to revisit some of the retro games from my childhood and some of them which I never got a chance to play. I have been revisiting some older Nintendo 64 titles, Playstation, and other 90's and 00's games. To me this was the golden age of video games, and even today is unmatched in the variety, the value, the originality and creativity, and frankly - it was the peak of gameplay. Graphics may have improved, but some games have yet to beaten out of their spot 2 decades later. Having been revisiting them, it dawned on me that I have been missing something from life. Video game music.

Video game music is such an important aspect of these retro games, that one without the other is almost unnatural. It has been by revisiting these, that I have also begun to explore music a bit more. I have begun to practice some very very basic DJ skills and recently picked up a Roland DJ-202 to practice with. The reason I chose the Roland over some of the others was that it alone contains a drum sequencer, and sampler within the entry-level model. As a major fan of old-school hiphop - I had to have some of those 808's in my mixes - especially right off the deck!

In other news - I figured I would update on my previous goals.

- I did start reviewing Rust, and I was enjoying the language and process. It is nice having a system-level language with some of the modern amenities.
    - For those who are looking for a great GUI system to get started with Rust - I highly recommend E-GUI - it effectively acts a OpenGL / WebGL rendered UI which is immediate, and can be used to quickly put together web/desktop apps with ease!

- Julia, on the otherhand - I have not been doing much with. At my day job, I have been more involved with some new data-analysis and data processing projects and since we are using Julia, I just have not been itching to get more hands-on as I tend to have quite a lot of activities during my job that scrtatches the itch. Maybe in the future I will revisit, but for now, I just don't have enough time and with another source of that type of data, I am fine for the time being, so I think that one will go to rest for now.

Finally, I have been thinking about ways in which to continue with the decentralized internet, and distributed computing. We have essentially missed out on the Web 3.0 that was promised, and unless things start to change, I don't see it comnig back anytime soon. The last 20 months have completely changed the face of the internet and the world as a whole. Unfortunately, I feel like we have lost a lot of options and the surface area these days seems smaller. I look forward to the new technologies to save us from the new technologies of today....One thing I know...it will not be corporate saviours...

Something has happened. I have never felt the internet being so small...my favourite places these days combined cannot provide me with a single days' worth of content. I reread the same articles multiple times a weak...its as if there are less than few thousand active users in the topics I am following. (Sure...if I want to see animal photos - those are millions a second, but if I want get some up-to-date information on a specific topic it is getting harder and harder it seems.) This appears to be driven by both content removal, content atrophy, content slide / link rot, and the most insidious type...censorship.

Whatever the primary causes, the fact remains - the internet feels smaller than ever before.
