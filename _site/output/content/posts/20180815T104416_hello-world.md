# Busy Life, Less Strife
~ 2018-08-15T10:44:16+00:00 ~

I feel blessed to have the opportunity to be busy in life. I feel like I am taking on a good amount of work and minimizing my downtime, and yet funny enough, I don’t feel overwhelmed.

I feel stressed for sure, but its the kind of stress I enjoy – purposeful stress. Stress driven by a goal that has yet to be met. I thrive in these situations and having the right balance of busy is the key to its success.

I typically have my priorities in a constant flux as I readjust throughout the day as new information comes to light, but I tend to stick to a few key “core” processes to manage them. These tend to be:

1. Daily Organization
2. Workload Estimation / Chunking
3. Scheduling
4. Delegation
5. Planning / Execution
6. Closure

Without these core concepts and processes I would not be able to handle my day. They are the basic necessities. There are many more processes and tools and methodologies that I employ, but these concepts run the engine.

#### Daily Organization

This is key – without an organized collection of ideas nothing will succeed. The way I tend to organize my day is through a simple ritual with some important tools.

- Prioritized Todo List \[Limited to 1-2 days of key projects/ideas\]
- Weekly Calendar \[Blocked off for meetings and used for scheduling tasks\]
- Detailed Task List \[Burndown list / PM Suite – has all the actual details\]
- Finally, Emails are checked last and are filtered for all relevant subjects and labelled \[using gmail filter options\]

By using these four tools, I am able to gather almost all the information I need at the start of a day to plan what needs to be done. As I mentioned, I check my emails last. I find it easier to adjust a smaller plan to add in a few things than it is to build a bigger plan from the start.

#### Workload Estimation / Chunking

Once I have my plan of attack, I tend to then begin to estimate the length of a time a task will take. I’ve heard it said that a reasonable measure of tasks is in 30 minute increments as no task truly can be switched back and forth with optimum performance in a short period of time.

To estimate, I figure out roughly how many blocks of 30 minutes I will need to accomplish the task. Then if it is over 5 blocks in size I decide if its a task that should be done at once, or split into 2 or more sections. Somethings are better done at once \[usually flow driven things or related tasks\] while others can be broken up over time \[such as analysis reports / updating documentation / auditing / etc\]

Then I have my chunks or pieces that I can now use alongside the calendar to schedule my work.

#### Scheduling

Having the chunks makes scheduling a breeze. It is literally like an OCD game of Tetris. You have to just find a way to fit in all the blocks into your calendar somewhere and then you can get a much better sense of how things are going to play out.

Now keep in mind that there are many ways to schedule the chunks when you have them. Sometimes you want to drag out the completion of something to perform more analysis or testing. These are instances where padding in a little bit every day is much more beneficial than trying to perform it all at once. This can also be useful when you need to appease multiple clients or work on multiple projects at one time and cannot afford to let either wait.

Essentially, you will need some insight into how you want to schedule your chunks, but in doing so will essentially define your execution timeline and roadmap.

#### Delegation

After you have scheduled your own blocks and figured out your schedule, you should now see if anything is better delegated off. Lets be clear here, you are only delegating tasks because they can be performed equally or better by these people, or there are higher value tasks which required your attention and focus. Delegation is a not to be lazy or shirk your responsibilities. It is to better distribute the workload so that the true priorities can be focused on.

Delegation is generally about focusing on a few things.

- Growth – the tasks should be delegated in a way that helps promote good habits and quality results
- Expertise – those who are best suited for a task should be ideally working on it, sometimes that means that in absence of expertise, a person becomes the expert at the mundane.
- Efficiency – Having multiple tasks run in parallel is a cornerstone of accelerated business processes. Being able to coordinate these is an art and requires insight into the actual players involved.

While I didn’t mention it here anywhere, another key idea is elimination, and during the delegation phase is also prudent to decide when to just cut things off. Somethings will not get finished and sometimes its best to eliminate the task so you can focus on the more important things at hand.

#### Planning / Execution

Once you have everyone with their roles and shedules you are ready to begin the real work. Planning and execution are the going to be different for each industry and the companies chosen workflow. Typically there is a planning phase, approval phase, development phase, review phase, and completion phase.

Anyone who has run a project knows that inevitably there will be iterations and revisions and things will never be what was originally planned, but regardless the planning is usually integral to the project’s success regardless of how many times you go back to it.

Execution is usually pretty straight forward once the plan is laid-out. It is typically the WHAT to the HOW and is where the rest of the stakeholders (employees / contractors / etc) come in.

This is usually more of an operations focused area, so I will it at that.

#### Closure

After all is said and done, there is usually a few things that need to be completed in addition to a project’s deliverables. These are usually things such as financials, sign-offs, agreements, etc. This stage is crucial for every part of your daily operations. When things are completed they need closure.

This applies in ways such as archiving old stuff, version existing stuff, draft up a final report or a summary of what was done. This closure provides a clean break and also helps bring everyone back onto the same page. Without this, some projects just go on and on without an end in sight.

Closure should be part of the process and should ideally be worked on during the process so that when it comes time to finish everything up, you just need to polish and shine a few things and not do the whole deal from scratch.

#### Closing Remarks

In all, I feel happy to be busy, and I hope that I can refine my techniques and get even busier! Not overwhelmed, just busy! =\]
