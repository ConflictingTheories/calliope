I have been on and off following different streams within the Blockchain and DLT spheres. They are typically driven by use-case and applications, so I haven’t been necessary trying every single thing that comes along. Something I am partly grateful for as well as kind of unsure about continuing. I recently found [Brave – the privacy browser](https://brave.com/kyl338) which also comes bundled with some nifty Blockchain integrations.

I tried it out this weekend and already I have decided to make it my new main browser. And here’s why:

- Privacy First
- Blockchain Wallet Integrated
- Ads which pay you – something I didn’t know existed
- Tor Integration &amp; .onion capabilities built in
- DuckDuckGo support in private mode as default search engine.
- Built in Ad Blocker
- Ability to auto-contribute to content creators to support them
- Slick interface and built on Chromium so it has all the capabilities Chrome has but without Google’s interface.

Now don’t get me wrong, I will still use both Firefox and Chrome from time to time as needed (such as work / testing), but from now on this is my main browser and I have never felt this way since I first found Firefox back when I was a young boy.

Now all we need a Blockchain based smart phone.
