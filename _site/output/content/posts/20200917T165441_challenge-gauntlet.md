# Challenge Gauntlet

I feel like I am in the middle of a gauntlet – the prize – a job. Over the last two weeks I have been tasked with 4 “take-home” assignments, multiple in-person technical interviews, personality interviews, coding challenges, and scenarios. That’s in addition to dozens of phone screens, calls, and emails, and applications.

It feels like at each location its always 1-3 people who each come from their own department and each have a barrage of semi-related questions – I typically walk away feeling like nothing I know was actually tested, and it is always more of a “personality” test than anything – even the technical interviews are more about “how I approach/think/etc” the problem as opposed to technical knowledge or real problem solving.

Finally, they typically like to combine a bunch of these together – so you do a take-home (obviously that should be the technical portion), but then they ask you technical questions (because perhaps you fluked the take-home?), and then they ask you personality questions (read ‘biased’ technical opined scenarios) and then they judge you on your depth, breadth, conciseness, and all other mystical traits of the divine software developer that you provided in your answers. Also — nothing is concrete and there are never any real KPI’s present in these assessments. Its all just gut feeling – even the technical stuff unless it has a “Correct” answer, is all just subjective.

Finally, they tell you in no definite terms that they will “be reviewing and making decisions soon”. But it leaves me reviewing them just as much. All in all – there have got to be a better way. This wastes everyone’s time.

Thanks for reading.
