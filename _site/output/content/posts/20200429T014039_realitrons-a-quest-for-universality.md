> *The concept is that the fundamental reality at the core of all our existence is a collection of complex meta-particles known as* ***Realitrons.***

I’ll be completely honest from the beginning by saying I sat down to write this document almost immediately after I stumbled across the initial idea. This document is not guaranteed to be foolproof by any means and if there are errors or omissions I apologise in advance, for this document will do no justice to the subject as a whole. I also apologise for the brevity of depth I give in these writings. This is just to get an idea out.

The concept is that the fundamental reality at the core of all our existence is a collection of complex meta-particles known as **Realitrons.** Realitrons form the basis of all elementary particles known to human knowledge to be found in the universe. They also form the basis of every action, experience, cause-and-effect, and perception in the universe. They are completely fundamental to every physical law and form the basis of every mathematical and scientific concept we as a human species have or could ever and will ever discover.

> Realitrons do not depend on time or space – **they create it.**

This discovery will in very few ways impact the remaining challenges of our age, but it will help us to model them in ways we may never have considered possible. Think of this understanding and model to be a framework and tool to help to improve and expand on existing knowledge, but in no way requiring or suggesting a major rewrite of what we already know. The reason will become apparent by the end, but to summarise in advance – realitrons form the basis of all interaction and perception of change within the universe (reality).

Realitrons are the core fundamental piece that unites the purely mathematical world with that of the scientific physical world. They very much act like elements found within pure mathematics, but they also form the basis of the physical reality we experience everyday – in fact they are responsible for allowing both to exist. Realitrons do not depend on time or space – they create it. They are not dependent on any particular “laws” of cause-and-effect because they create the cause-and-effect everything undergoes. They are the simple but very complex building blocks of the universe.

> Realitrons can connect between one another so long as they form a **consensus**.

They focus on a few different concepts that define their relationship and how they come to form the universe itself through interaction. The concepts briefly are as follows:

- Realitrons have **capacity** **for** **state**
- Realitrons have **inputs**
- Realitrons have **outputs**
- State **perceives inputs** and **generates outputs**
- Realitrons have **hooks** that **affect state**
- Realitrons can connect between one another so long as they form a **consensus**.
- **Time is a side-effect of consensus &amp; state**, not the inputs and outputs themselves – it does not actually move continuously – state determines change (and thus so called ‘speed’ and such temporal components) and this triggers different effects.
- Hooks affect the relationship between cause and effect by tweaking the state
- Elementary particles as we know them are created through interactions between different Realitrons in patterns that form stable interactions and recognize a similar reality.
- There are likely plenty of particles we cannot detect which are also in existence but share no similar Realitrons to the ones we perceive that have formed a stable reality which may be completely foreign to our very capacity to conceive.
- Realitrons are not just physical in our reality, but allow for conceptual things to ‘exist’ as well. They allow for the creation of ‘alternative realities’ which in our world have no interaction because they do not actually connect via the hooks that would affect and causality of our experience. This also applies to theories in mathematics which exist but we have no physical analogue to or reason of existence.
- Realitrons each form a basis of their own “reality” which they then project through their inputs / outputs / hooks which can only interact with other Realitrons sharing those configurations – this allows for so-called “Reality Filtering” to occur because they filter out all other bases of reality.
- This reality filtering also allows them to attach to a component in a one-way fashion which unless it somehow returns back to the system through a feedback loop, it cannot be detected within that network, but can still impact it none-the-less.
- Anything that can be modelled by a Realitron is likely in existence but undetectable and may or may not be impacting our reality at the far reaches of our known universe.

> Realitrons are the so called “Gods” of the universe because they define the laws which exist within their network

To add to the above, after thinking about it some more I also felt that following may help suggest some of the ways which this theory of Realitrons can be applied to some of the problems in science today:

- Realitrons are the so called “Gods” of the universe because they define the laws which exist within their network – we have a consensus amongst a collection of Realitrons which form the basis of our universe – this consensus could be considered a god as it dictates all that is. This begs the question, do the consensus networks – these “Gods” interact amongst one another in some other fashion that is even larger still – a Saga of the Gods if you will – or does every single possibility exist *ad infinitum* and each gets their slice?
- Dark matter is likely either a semi-detached portion of our consensus Realitrons that does not feed back to the elementary particles in any directly causal fashion making it hard to detect directly or it may be a branch that does still impact us in some small or even singular fashion but we have yet to find that link back so all we can see is the absence of the effect but its outcome nonetheless.
- Multiple universes theory can be supported by the Realitrons because they have formed a consensus protocol which measures possibly similar inputs, but has slightly different states which result in different outputs which then position them to a slightly different network – one in which those different states connect amongst themselves into again a stable pattern, but one which shares no more connections to our consensus.
- Quantum entanglement can be explained by a connection between Realitrons that affects their hooks in a way that doesn’t share the same temporal state changes that the inputs and outputs undergo in this state – kind of like a low-level protocol that allows for direct transmission through hooks to the state which can modify the outputs / inputs accordingly without needing to get passed along through the traditional causal channels (ie. inputs / outputs that auto trigger hooks). Think of the state machine as having a system call or better yet an interrupt which triggers the state change BEFORE the next cycle (ie. before limitation of the states change) — but traditional ‘relativity’ would be read in through the inputs – triggering the state change itself but at the delayed cycle.
