# Combating Loneliness in an isolated world
~ 2020-04-03T02:58:13+00:00 ~

Most people by now are feeling the effects of isolation begin to set in. Its a lot more lonely under these circumstances and it is hard to find purpose in a world so vastly different from the one we were experiencing just over a month behind us.

I know that it can be tough for a lot of people to stay indoors and remain isolated because they have so many things they want to do. Sitting at home isn’t one of them. But despite these challenges, I know that each and every one of us has the tools to manage the monotony. This boredom should not be the strain we worry about – real health challenges are present, and there are going to be very real financial challenges for many and for some already.

Boredom is not the issue we should worry about because we have the tools for that at our disposal – and I am not talking about Netflix. We have out imaginations – the most powerful tool we all carry. Its time to remember what it was like as a kid to imagine and day dream. We can come up with all sorts of new ideas if we champion our own imaginations during this time.

Its not something that we may be used to and for some it will not be possible as they will have much more challenging issues to face, but for the rest of us who have fortunate enough to have only isolation to deal with – we should be looking to make use of our imaginations once again and rekindle some of that creativity.

Here is a list of some things I thought about which may help curb your boredom:

- Pick a Song – Turn up the volume – Start recording &amp; Dance! Then share the video with friends or the public – make them laugh or feel uplifted
- Try some meditation – its not easy BTW – but if you are feeling bored – read about some meditation techniques and spend the next 3 weeks practising them every day for a short period of time when you are feeling bored.
- Draw a picture, make a painting, colour in a drawing you find online, make a diorama, redecorate your room or home, make a website, etc.
- Or perhaps start thinking about a business idea – maybe you have had one for a while. Now you can think on it with some new perspective given the situation
- Look for an online hackathon or support group. Find a new forum or start contributing to one you frequent. Think about starting a blog or making a profile on a publishing site.
- Start a cult (joking) – but you can always read about them, or start looking into history or pop culture – there is always something new to read about and discover.
- Find some new YouTube stars or channels, and start following some new material. How about listening to some new podcasts or genres.
- Be silly – dance alone, talk to yourself, make up stories or jokes, and remember it will be over soon.

We can get through this – boredom be damned!
