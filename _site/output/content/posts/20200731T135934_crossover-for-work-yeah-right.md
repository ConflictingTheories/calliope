# CROSSOVER for Work &#8211; Yeah Right!

Crossover for Work is a sham. They have no respect for their own process and because of this – here are some solutions to their stupid online assessments. Stupid because I passed each section and literally waited to reply with my final piece before an interview so that I would not waste my time doing multiple pieces until they could be checked.

Despite this – and passing with 98% out of 100%, and finding their assessment tedius but simple – they decided that they would not move ahead (with the 30 minute interview – the last phase) probably because they actually do not have any jobs available and no humans.

Really – not even a final call – 30 minutes for finishing your 5-6 hour assessment? – Seems like your assessments are poorly designed and do not align – or your staff are incompetent.

**Regardless**:

Here are some tools to help people going for the Technical Product Manager Position (TPM).

Additionally they have some multiple choice – not going to bother with those. And for the [Coding Challenges – see my page for solutions.](https://kyledm.ca/programming-challenges/ "Programming Challenges")

Here are some specifications they ask you to review in the interview process – just have a good read ahead of time – then provide your answers when ready:

And here is a template for their P1 Assessment:

Sadly, they probably do not care – so I do not care. Don’t waste my time – your tests are dumb, and frankly I can tell you don’t actually need intelligence – you need robots.
