# Bye Wheat :( &#8211; Hello GlutenTRAX
~ 2020-02-08T03:42:57+00:00 ~

Near the end of last year I was diagnosed with celiac disease. While it was nice to know the cause of some discomfort I had been experiencing, it was a sad realisation that I could no longer enjoy gluten-containing products. At first I thought I could cheat every once in a while (obviously against better judgement) and in the first month and a half afterwards I didn’t really change my diet and just continued on as usual. I didn’t feel great, but I wasn’t ready to give up gluten, yet.

This year I started on the gluten free diet albeit in the first week I cheated a bit. Since starting I have been hoping I would notice some changes and at first I didn’t notice anything, but unbeknown to myself – I accidentally ingested some wheat this past weekend in an unlikely place. Previously I would not have thought anything of it and it probably would have gone largely unnoticed, but because I have actually been following the diet for about 3 weeks solid at that time, my body had apparently already begun to make adjustments. I was horribly ill the next two days and the rest of this week I have not been 100% – even today I am still feeling a bit out of sorts.

It became apparent immediately following getting sick that I need to avoid gluten products adamantly. I no longer have the luxury of cheating, but the good news is I have already begun to find alternatives to my previous diet – the only problem I see – everything is much more expensive if it doesn’t happen to be gluten free normally. So many things have wheat additives, barley additives, and it is mind-boggling to me how many things I now need to read the labels for. My grocery bill and time spent certainly jumped quite a bit and I am definitely going to wish I was paying for my original grocery list.

There is a tiny ray of hope though – you can claim a tax credit on your annual tax return. It just requires you follow an annoyingly tedious process just in case they choose to audit you one day – that’s the worse part…it could be for nothing in end. This got me thinking about some solutions to make the problem less annoying and I came up with a simple answer – a basic mobile app for tracking and scanning all the gluten free products I buy. It could be used to track, match, and log all my purchases necessary to file my taxes and then provide a simple report export for my annual or monthly tracking.

I call the project GlutenTRAX. It will be a simple app which I plan on making offline and free to use. It will be my gift to the community of which I am newly apart of.
