I have always had a philosophical issue with the idea of hiring for ‘Fit’ vs hiring based on talent, but I have never been able to reduce it in favour of one or the other. It has always left itself remaining unformed and grey in mind. This vexes me and is this basis for this article.

On the one hand, you have a concept of ‘Fit’ which is typically characterized as being of a good cultural|experiential|network|collegiate|personality ‘Fit’, but can rarely be truly articulated as what it is – being almost inherently subjective.

On the other hand, is it in the best interest of the company to hire a person based on talent if no one else on the team necessarily ‘Fits’ with them, but they can do the necessary practical component.

Logic would dictate, that the choice should align with the business’ interests and that the person chosen should be what most exemplifies those interests. Since a business is in the basis of making profit (charities / non-profits aside), it is likely that the primary interest is that it grow profitability and maintain such profits such as to not shrink them in any way.

This would then require a holistic view of the options available and is likely to come to the conclusion that in some cases where the output is driven primarily by practical systems and skill-based outcomes that talent would best align; and in areas where output is driven by collaboration and collective synergies that ‘Fit’ would be the best driver.

But I then dig deeper in my thoughts and begin to ponder the second moment of analysis – can a cultural fit be converted into a type of talent or vice-versa – can talent be seen as a cultural fit? For if so – then perhaps a single perspective can encompass both views without paradox.

What would such a fit or talent look like? Some options would be IQ, EQ, AQ, Myers-Briggs, Value-Driven Assessments, Technical Assessments, and more. Effectively – it seems to come down to some form of test…but if such a test has been written, than it must have come from some form of subjective view itself – which would suggest that an auto-correcting assessment (recursive) would need to be in-place to first ensure that such a fit could be had in the first place (to avoid those so-called unconscious biases from contaminating the tests)

Effectively, what appears to be at first a simple problem becomes very quickly into a non-trivial computation. So…after pondering some more it seems like hiring someone is an NP-Hard problem and no matter what HR companies will tell you, and recruiting firms will say, and blah blah blah….they CANNOT know they found the best fit —– EVER.

So….my suggestion. Have a **rubric** and basic **KPIs**, and a **MOSCOW** Method.

— **Must** Have

— **Should** Have

— **Could** Have

— **Wont** Have

Then – Set yourself up an **Iterator** Max and **Threshold**s. Process X candidates from a pool of Y in chunks of Z – if N candidates in Z meet S, Offer – Else Process next Chunk – etc.

The fact is — any method is pretty much bullshit – and is not much better than tossing coins. Make a system that is a system first and foremost for hiring, then worry about fit.
