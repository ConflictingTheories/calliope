# A New Social Network
~ 2021-04-29T08:55:51+00:00 ~


I have been thinking about the need for a new social network, and I am not talking about a new brand of the same old hashed formula. I am thinking we need to revision what we have presently and fix the flaws not by correcting the current incarnations, but rather by building the better solutions.

Many people have been attempting to do this for quite some time, and some are much more successful in carving out a new niche than others, but I sense they all ultimately aren't that different except perhaps in either their audience, or their hosting method.

What I am envisioning is a kind of new social network built less around the concept of the **ubiquitous feed** and replace it with something new....I am thinking that it should be akin to a house.

Traditional social networks are kind of digital bulletin boards (BBS) mixed with photobooks and the idea of online friends / followers / connections / etc. The modern version are most often centred around a central feed of information much analogous to a faucet. People consume the feed and additionally they interact with it and through the feed, they communicate amongst each other. Without the feed, the only means of communication are through direct messages (consequently another type of feed).

While this concept at first glance seems like an obvious part of a social network, if not just any data driven system, I would argue that the analogy of the faucet is particularly fitting because it can easily be replaced with a vending machine, a syringe, or drug dispensory and the addictive nature becomes apparent. This is pretty well accepted at this point, but they are never-the-less addicted to consuming content. 

This problem is actually double sided and neither are good sides. The other side is the dark side of the feed, which is that this same mechanism is what is directly responsible for the proliferation of low-calorie information and more and more aggressive advertising techniques. This relationship is very parasitic towards the general user, and in the end it chooses to get more benefits for the feed over the individuals who interact with the feed.

I want to remove the feed as the central means of data transfer, and replace it with an exploratory approach which I believe will be equally engaging, but less prone to abuse. The primary means I have thought about are as mentioned above, much like a house. People should be free to arrange their digital homes in a fashion which provides all the utility of the feed to the individual, but less aggressive and parasitic tendencies in the advertising.

People typically have a lot of themselves in their homes, and they like to arrange the same items in different ways to showcase their individual preferences. Having a digital home, would add a dimension of existence to the concept of social networks. People would explore and meet in places which would have a unique sense of place as opposed to all feeling like message boards as they presently do.

This would also provide advertisers with a chance to redeem themselves and start to provide some mutual good when they advertise to users. Rather than aggressively bombarding them with headlines and taglines and hyperbole, they would be required to start to make things artistic, interesting and would need to draw attention and it could not be done so quickly through simple feed manipulation. It would be because of some intrinsic value within the experience of the ad itself that would be the reason for its success. It would return some of the humanity in social network advertising without replacing it with paywalls and subscription services.

I have begun to work on a design for such a network, and I hope that in the coming months I can proceed to make some progress on my prototype and build a better tomorrow online.
