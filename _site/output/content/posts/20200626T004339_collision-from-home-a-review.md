# Collision from Home &#8211; A Review
~ 2020-06-26T00:43:39+00:00 ~

Collision from Home just finished, and I feel like overall it could have been better – at least that is my opinion. It was definitely not in anyway a bad experience overall, but there were some pain points.

I should say first that I did enjoy some of the experience, but it was not what I had been hoping for in my heart. Now – to be fair, my criticisms will be based on my personal expectations and opinions, and should in no way be used as anything more than an opinion. I was also unable to afford my complete attention, so many of the moments were not experienced by me in full as I was concurrently working during those times. With these in mind – let me explain my reasoning.

#### The Good

Lets start first with the good parts, so that we can approach the criticisms within the spectrum of my perspectives as opposed to themselves alone.

- Broad Range of Topics Across the Convention
- Simple Registration Process / Login
- Chat / Networking seemed well thought out
- They kept engagement up by providing lots of different areas to focus attention at any given time.
- Typically more than one talk about a subject
- Edward Snowden as usual is always good to listen to
- A few speakers who actually criticised some of the issues in our society as opposed to just looking at the positives.

Overall – I would say that the above were positive points for me. Some were to do with the general event such as the Topics and the Engagement, but two of the elements were simply the process of managing the App w/ the Browser.

#### The Bad

Now for the areas I felt were lacking from the experience.

- Not enough depth. Almost all the talks I listened to felt shallow or hurried.
- Too many sales / marketing infused discussions – it seems like there were a lot of ‘sales pitches’ outside of the startup pitching where its expected.
- Some talks just weren’t focused – a lot of the panels seemed to get off topic or would deviate from a central theme to muse.
- Some talks were not really about what they appeared to be about – the descriptions seemed to be either just about the initial intro or sometimes mini closing statements.
- I felt like this convention was less aimed at technologists / engineer types and more focused on sales &amp; marketing which I was not expecting (maybe Web Summit is better?).

#### The Ugly

These next areas were just awful in my opinion and would be reasons for me to recommend against paying for the experience (I got my ticket from Open Source program so it was free)

- Workshops continued to fail on Days 1 &amp; 2 – sadly I was most interested in the workshops when looking at the schedule, but I was unable to attend them due to technical issues
- Some speakers/talks just disappeared – I am not sure if they were absent speakers, or if there were technical problems – but the were a few times where the original talk didn’t line up with the video that was shown (typically it was just another channel playing)
- Talks had no real technical discussions. It was not a technical conference at all – as I got my ticket through the Open Source program I was expecting a technical conference and instead I was fed just marketing discussions and topical trending issues of today (all of which I get fed from social media constantly)
- Race, Gender Identity, Sex, Politics, Sports, and Sociology seemed to get more discussion than any actual technologies themselves and there was very little STEM present at the convention.
- What small amount of STEM was present was far too focused on A.I. – each was just another rehash of the same marketing speech over and over again – there were a couple explanations but nothing I would recommend over 3Blue1Brown.
- And worst of all – I learned nothing new except people’s opinions or their hunches or their hopes.

All in all – I hope that Collision is better next year – because I really and truly wanted it to be awesome, but all I found was the echo-chamber that permeates the social media spheres when discussing technologies – marketing blather and little depth or references.
