# 4D Privacy Tokens - Sovereign IDs
~ 2021-01-10T10:24:00+00:00 ~

I have been thinking about possible ways to envision access and credential management, and I have also really wanted it to have not just a good UX, but a satisfying one. I want it to be attractive and sleek, but also unique amd custom. 

The challenge is trying to find a way of incorporating these ideas all in one package that doesn't feel extraneous in anyway. 

### 4D Tokens

One such method is to use 4D tokens as part of the security - this allows you to inject your own information while still have some underlying process of managing it. THe issue is that these typically need to be synchryonized and if it is universal that would require it to match a universal spec that is both efficient and practical (given that some devices will inevitable vary in their physical properties and resources).

I saw some papers showcasing the concept as applied to QR codes and I thought it was quite a unique approach to the process - it involved the use of encoding data across different colour channels and then having the QR code act much like a gif.

I think you could apply the same concept but much more subtly if you are not working with physical optical scanning (like they were) -- Instead of adding additional complexity to it - while it can be rendered in a visually pleasing way - the point will be to encode the data in the image, but not necessarily with the intent of immediately using it for optical scanning - in fact I prefer an algorithmic approach.

These are not meant to replace the QR code - because this concept is focused on a much different approach - encrypted validated data and credentials within an visually appealing and customizable symbol.

### Customization

Because of the inherit desire to have personality and identity that we all mostly have, it is clear to me - that we should be embracing this within our standards. It sounds kind of oxymmoronic to say a custom standard - but is that not what the internet has become?

I think we can apply the same such customizable nature to smaller facets of our digital lives - such as credentials, identity management, and banking.

I have written previously in favour of using custom currencies and issuance of self-collateralized currency, and this is an extension if not better called a precursor to that idea. In order to have self-collateralized currency - it needs to be customiable and it needs to safe from double spends etc.

### Vision

I see these concepts combining to provide a 4D almost effervescent 'flowy' or 'liquid-like' displays of custom seals, symbols, avatars, and other representations of self. These hologram-like digital representations would be visually very similar, but could be coded for all sorts of different data - allowing for some data to be you and yet you can confirm that this token is signed by that person.

The concept would be a lot like the concept of a Tulpa - except that you could split it and send it off to different place to represent you and your information. Down the line you wrap them around contractual layers and other logic allowing you to have essentially digital agents on your behalf running their predetermined roles as you.

This would allow everyday people to start to control their privacy and personal information, have a unique and customizable tool they can share ad adjust without losing its merit and security, and allow for people setup automation in their lives knowing they are doing what they are supposed to and should their be some sort of data leak - it will not extend beyond the permission set of that 4D represtion.

All in all - I think it will allow for the right balance between freedom - individuality - and standardised exchange mediums.

I won't go into detail about how I envision doing this - some papers have been written on the subject so I will defer to them. I will say though - it uses stenography.

Thanks for Reading.
