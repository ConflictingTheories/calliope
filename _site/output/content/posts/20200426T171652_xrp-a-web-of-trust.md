# XRP &#8211; A Web of Trust
~ 2020-04-26T17:16:52+00:00 ~

XRP is one of the cryptocurrencies which I have been following and working with. The ones I have worked with to some degree specifically are:

- IOTA
- Ethereum
- EOS
- XRP
- Stellar

There are plenty of others which I have looked into and a few years back I was day trading in a few different coins including Bitcoin. Now-a-days I rarely do much for day trading, but I am still very much interested in their applications.

To me, they should be driven by utility and then they can form an asset. As money this is fine, but with energy consumption on the rise due to PoW it causes concerns about the long term viability of such coins which do not provide other means of providing value.

Ripple’s XRP is one such coin which I find interesting because of the very nature of its applications. It most definitely has a use case, and does not suffer from the needless consumption in the form of PoW. It also provides one of the most unique mechanisms which I cannot help but become instantly enamoured with – namely issuance based on trust.

Trust lines and issuance are the primary factors which separate XRP from any other coin (closest would be Ethereum) . It essentially allows willing participants to setup their economies as they wish. It has built in interest rates, lending, and even allows for partnerships to form amongst issuing parties. Essentially it democratises the world’s currrencies.

No other platform has this laser focus – and it is one of the reasons I follow it. I know it will be useful and practical and much like SWIFT before it, will entrench itself deeply into the fabric of the economy.
