If you follow programming blogs enough you will be familiar with the state of ‘flow’ and people’s desire to reach and remain in it. This term also shows up in a few other places with some frequency including productivity books and podcasts. In all cases they refer to a state of mind where you are hyper-focused on the task at hand and have access to creativity and ingenuity which is typically higher than your normal conscious self.

In this state you are more productive, more creative, and typically unaware of its existence. Problems are solved without fatigue and time passes in the blink of an eye. It is only after it dissolves away that you come to realise you were in the state at all and many people are left seeking it like its a drug. Hell, you could argue that there are entire sections of the internet and local bookstores devoted to unlocking this state of mind – the same thing can be said about Zen Buddhism in a way.

Unlike Mindfulness Meditation, which was a hot trending topic a couple years ago, Zen Meditation is in my opinion, less popular (in the trendy sense) – but has more of a historical retro trendiness that I am unaware of Mindfulness having. What I mean by this is that more people have heard about Zen Buddhism and the idea of Zen than may be familiar with Mindfulness, but I don’t necessarily suggest they understand it (I don’t profess to understand it – these are just my musings and random opinions).

Because of this, I think some people who do not practice the religion, may internally scoff when they hear the term Zen and may equate it to some sort of stereotypical interpretation. The reason I am referring to Zen Meditation is because I believe they share many of the same commonalities with the Flow state. Let me explain.

### Flow &amp; Zen (or the state of No-Mind)

It was explained to me once while meditating at a Zen Monastery that the goal if that is even the appropriate word in this case, is to attain a state of “No-Mind”. It is in this state where you no longer have desires, fears, hopes, dreams, sadness or longing – it is only a state of acceptance and existence in the moment. You cannot be happy when you reach this point because happiness is a state of mind which goes against the tenets of No-Mind – at the same time, you cannot be sad or any other emotional state.

Some of you may be thinking “Big deal, that sounds pretty easy – just don’t think and be detached?” but I can assure you it very hard – because of the following correlation: you cannot seek this state of mind – you cannot seek Zen. To seek is to give thought – to have mind – you cannot achieve no-mind while seeking or wanting. This is tricky part – Zen comes to you, but you cannot go to Zen – much like the state of Flow.

Its true, you can help coax yourself into that state – through relaxation, meditation, rituals, or process – but it not a state you can force. Much like being in a state of acceptance, being in the flow state is one of acceptance. You accept the hurdles, the troubleshooting, the bugs, the logic, the flow and UI of the project without consciously giving mind to them. You just deal with them as they come in the moment, but you do not worry or reminisce while in the state of Flow – it is just being. I am wondering if practising Zen meditation will help me with achieving a state of flow.

I propose a challenge – a 30-day Zen Flow Challenge. For the next 30 days – spend 15-20 minutes a day practising Zen Meditation and also try track the # of times you reach a Flow state. Keep a journal and commit to spending the time – don’t quit or skip it – and to help you do that – WRITE THE TABLE FIRST – IN INK and with DATES. This way all you are doing is filling out the form, not building it as you go. After the 30 days – look back and see if you have found it to be beneficial.

For those who aren’t sure how to practice Zen Meditation, here are some pointers and tips to help you succeed:

- Find a Comfortable Position (if something hurts or is uncomfortable to start, it wont work)
- Play some rhythm heavy music with little-to-no high notes and no vocals. Something deep and pulsing.
- Make the area smell nice, but not strongly – just something subtle that keeps your mind at ease (avoid anything too invigorating)
- Give your hands someplace to be. If your hands feel fidgety, its going to be very hard to meditate – it is okay to wrap them or place them comfortably on your knees, etc.
- You can either keep your eyes open or closed, but usually it is easier to meditate with your eyes closed.
- Stretch beforehand, do a light jog (just enough to raise your heart rate slightly) but don’t get breathless or fatigued.
- Drink a glass of water beforehand and go to the bathroom if needed.

### Suggestions for beginners on how to start to Meditate:

- When you are ready – take some slow and very deep breaths (must be at least 6 in a row) and then begin to slowly breath normal full breaths.
  1. Focus on the Breathing
  2. Try to make each breath as similar to each other as you can
  3. Try to take as long breathing in as breathing out on each breath
  4. Now try to find the frequency which feels most natural while keeping the above still going – this will require you expend some control over your lungs to achieve.
- As you are doing this, you may have some thoughts – these may be pictures, images, sounds, internal voices, fears, doubts, anxiety, discomfort, day dreams and more. ANYTIME a thought comes up that is NOT the act of breathing itself and that includes breathing related thoughts such as “am I doing this right, are my lungs full enough, etc” the only thing you need to do is go back to breathing.
  - Do not engage with them, instead just in as little energy as you can manage it – **acknowledge, disregard, resume breathing.**
      - Acknowledge the thought \[recognise you are having it\]
      - Then disregard it – ideally without thinking unnecessarily
      - and focus back on ensuring you have the most even breathing you can.
- If you repeat this process enough, and just keep going back to the act of breathing, you will force your mind to try harder and harder. Each thought you dismiss will make your brain try to find something else to distract you with.
- At first, it will be easy to distract you. You will gladly think about your back, that itch that just appeared, your clothes bunching up, a sweaty spot, perhaps a gurgling stomach or you might start to notice your jaw and the weight it has. These are the first challenges you must overcome – in both Zen and Flow for these have no place in either state of mind. I call this the **Physical** Layer.
- Following the basic physical tricks, you will have additional challenges ahead. These are typically based on the present moments in your life and the next couple of weeks around of you. They are usually time related or errands and come in the form of anxiety, tasks, sudden urges to begin new projects, realisations that you forgot something, or sudden dread that if you don’t do something in time…..I call this the **Temporal** Layer.
- Now, if you continue to persevere, meditate enough and practise – eventually you will be quite capable of dealing with the previous challenges, and your mind will need a new trick up its sleeve – in this case it will usually be more deeply rooted thoughts from a more personal nature. It could be your desires that begin to visualise in your mind’s eye, or perhaps it is more sinister and instead your fears begin to take root. These may be events from your past that your mind brings back, or it could be regrets – it could also be fond memories and nostalgia. Regardless, these distractions will be deeply personal and will be difficult to dismiss. Typically people go through many layers of their personal challenges over multiple sessions of meditation and rarely can progress be made in a single session at first. I call this the **Personal** Layer.
- After enough sessions and depending on each individuals own dispositions, they will eventually get past those personal challenges, but they aren’t finished yet. After the personal challenges, the mind begins to get desperate – your experiences didn’t cut it, so now we have to target your beliefs. I have some varying opinions on this stage of meditation – I think its extremely personal – so to try and generalise will be hard, but based on my experiences – I found that after all your personal challenges, your mind begins to ask larger questions and some are abstract. It is here that I believe we start to tap into our discovery phase – everything up to this point is very reflective – we typically are measuring our life and the world immediately around us and it is almost wholly based on our predispositions and assumptions, it is only after we have made it here – to the **Discovery** Layer – that we can begin to attain Zen or Flow. For many, attaining the Discovery layer is all that people will achieve. It is the most difficult to pass, and it is not for the reasons that the other layers may have been. The Discovery layer traps people because they are content to remain in that layer. They can ask questions that perhaps have no answers and mistake that for having No-Mind. It is also very liberating for those who are trying to be creative because this layer brings with it lots of creativity – in-fact it may be more creative than any other state.
- Finally, is **Zen**. I have only achieved this state a couple times in my life. I cannot describe it except through two words **ineffably beautiful**. However, because of the challenges of the previous layer, almost no one will achieve Zen without serious dedication – the quest for Zen can hardly compete with the dopamine rush that the discovery layer brings with it. This is where I would like to make another similarity with Flow – many people seek flow and are desperate to get it and they mistake other false states sometimes for Flow itself. This is typically when someone begins to believe they can only achieve flow if they do X, or they become hyper focused on a feature, or issue that they begin to miss the bigger picture. This is very common when projects pivot and features are slashed or cut – many programmers lose productivity because they lose interest or they feel dismayed at their work being shelved. It also happens when high risk projects get started – sometimes people overly value a new experiment and prioritise it wrongly. Neither of these are the Flow state – but many people will mistake their enthusiasm (or sudden loss of it) as somehow being related to Flow – this is not so. Flow has no enthusiasm – it is only acceptance and decision. So once again – Flow is very much like Zen.

I hope these help you out – once again – these are all based on my personal experience and practise, but it may not be the best for you. However, I encourage you to try the techniques out because you may get some good mileage from them. Take care and thanks for reading!
