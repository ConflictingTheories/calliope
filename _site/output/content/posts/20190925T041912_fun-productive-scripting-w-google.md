I find myself from time to time playing around with Google Scripts, and I am pleased to say they have been improving both their documentation and their integrations within their GSuite product line over the last few years.

As a GSuite user I find it pleasing to be able to automate a lot of things which would otherwise be annoying to perform manually, and since I try to abstain from buying Add-ons or extensions from the marketplace and prefer free software where possible, it provides me a simple and quite effective way of performing many things without spending anything but a few hours hear and there.

Some of the things I have done using Google Scripts are:

- Organize, Archive, and Rename Files within Drive
- Generate Mail Merges and create Dynamic Document Templates
- Manage my Gmail &amp; perform filtering / lookups / etc.
- Generate more complicated macros that cannot be manually recorded.
- Simulate calculations and perform more procedural operations within my spreadsheets such as custom Monte Carlo simulations and more.
- Automate Forms &amp; Surveys more efficiently &amp; Capture Anonymous Feedback

If you have ever played with VBA within the Microsoft Office Suite, then you can get a sense of some of the possibilities using Google Scripts, but with the syntax of JavaScript (which for me is a bonus).

So, if you use GSuite – don’t miss looking into their Scripting platform!
