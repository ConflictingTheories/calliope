# Buckets: Measuring my state of affairs
~ 2018-10-19T05:16:03+00:00 ~

I decided today to try and get a better sense of personal understanding regarding my happiness and my goals. Instead of trying to define my goals in more detail, I decided to do the opposite – take a step back and see things in a broader sense. Using a new idea learned from my boss at work, I decided to break my life down into my core “buckets” and see it from a new perspective.

The concept of buckets will likely be familiar to a lot of you but maybe with a new twist or just a different name, but it should also be new to quite a few of you as well. The concept is simple – you have some key values or goals or mottos that you strive for in life. Define these, and try not to go too deep. If something is a subset of something else, try and combine them. The reason for this is that it makes the final result a lot easier to analyze. Once you have done it at a simple level, it becomes easier to expand on the foundation.

Once you have the initial values or goals in mind, take a sheet of paper and write them down in a particular order. The order is like so:

**Critical**

The critical values or goals are the things that you cannot do without and are extremely important to you. These will be different for most people but typically carry a lot of commonalities. The first is these values or goals tend to sustain your livelihood in some way. Secondly, they tend to be integral to your ability to achieve success regardless of your path going forward. These are not short term or flimsy values and goals. These are things you can for the time being count on. Think of these as your load bearing pillars in a house.

**Ideal**

The ideal values are the ones in which you personally seek validation, enjoyment, success, and are the ones that are most likely to give you a “conscious” sense of day-to-day success. These are not necessarily long term or constant values, and they may reflect your pastimes, interests, or that which gives you a measure of success in a group. Some examples would include sports, clubs, personal hobbies. Think of these as the framing and structure of the house.

**Capstone**

The capstone value(s) is the one that completes the rest. Nothing should depend on the capstone value, but the capstone can depend on one or more of the other values. The purpose of the capstone is to provide that which the others do not provide but which will promote the others the most and have the potential for the most change overall. Again this will be different for every person. The capstone is the key, but it is not necessary to have achieved it. It does not support the others and can be left unfinished or incomplete.

#### Now what?

So what is the main concept exactly? Once you have organized your values into the three categories, its time to draw. For each one of your values, you are going to draw a bucket shaped object. Try to space them out so that the critical values are on one line, the ideal the same, and the capstone on its own.

Once you have them drawn out, its time to figure out how much you feel you have filled your bucket. By fill, I mean how much do you feel satisfied with that goal. In a percentage, what is your satisfaction? Are you 50% satisfied, are you 70% satisfied? Once you have an idea, I want you to colour in the bucket roughly that percentage in height.

Next, I want you to decide what would make you content – not ecstatic or extremely proud, just content. Now once again place it as a percentage. Try to be realistic and really ask yourself what would you want to be content with. Draw a line at that percentage up the bucket in a different colour.

Once you have done this for each bucket, you can now have a good look at what personally feel about each of these values. You will most likely have some areas you have neglected and feel you should something to make better, and unless you are extremely happy and successful in life, you probably haven’t fulfilled your contentedness in each bucket. This now gives you a good hard look at what you value and what you need to focus on. This isn’t the end though.

#### Order of operations

Its time to figure out what to work on first. Since you have already broken down the buckets into three categories you have already done the ranking for yourself. Critical items are more important than ideal ones, and the capstone should wait until you have reach the level of contentedness in the rest. This will help you align with your priorities and stop worrying so much about what you need to do. What you need to do will fall into these values. If you cannot fit it in one of these values, it isn’t worth your effort.

The final thing to do is to see how each one effects the other. Some values are inclusive and provide inter-value benefits, others are mutual and suffer and gain together while others may be parasitic in nature and drain one in favour of itself, and the some just don’t interfere with one another at all. This will also help you see how to prioritize your change. If something is counter intuitive to another, you will have to prioritize one over the other for the time being. If something is mutually beneficial, it may be useful to focus on those to gain the benefits quickly rather than focusing on something with little to no return.

All in all, I feel that if you look at life in buckets, it can help you to take a step back and see the bigger picture. Too often do we focus on the details.

Cheers.
