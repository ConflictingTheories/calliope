Everyday people struggle to optimize their processes as they are increasingly reporting feelings of stress and burnout. Entire industries have built up around this problem and are varied in their approach to a solution.

Some of those approaches are quite popular such as Agile, Lean, Scrum, and the ever present PMI system. With these systems usually come some implicit beliefs or axioms. They are usually focused around that systems KPIs and formulate their methodologies based on adhering to optimizing them. These systems are great when applied correctly, but they tend to all suffer a fatal flaw – they are applied as a bandaid and a fix-all when really they are far from perfect systems and require insight into properly applying them for specific situations. Not every team should be agile, etc.

To combat this, another industry has arisen which are essentially consultancies which have rebranded themselves for their particular specialties. Advertising Work packages and tailored solutions, they act as the guides through the forest of methodologies. Unfortunately, they come at a cost and again, rarely are their systems comparable or compatible with someone else’s. Thus we lose the ability to objectively analyze their performances in a meaningful way.

A Basic Example

If you ascribe to the Scrum methodology, your KPIs are velocity, story points, reopening of issues, and epics. Typically the Scrum master aims to optimize the teams velocity by gathering as much information aka stories from the product owner. These are collected into epics and then sprints. Each story is broken up into issues which are given storypoints. Then they are organized into sprints which help to minimize the amount of impact that may occur due to future pivots. So how then, do we compare this to the more traditional waterfall system which is driven by duration, budget, and a confined scope of work. Typically you can’t. You just choose which system has the values you want to focus on.

So how then, do we know if we picked the right system? Well, the guides are there sure, but then again you can’t be sure you picked the right guide either, and there we have a paradox. Instead you need to be able to quickly guage the differences and forecast and try new ways to truly figure out what works. This is hard for a lot of people and companies. They don’t know when to change, they don’t know what to change and they have a tough time visualizing or communicating it to all the parties.

That’s where EARN comes in.

EARN is designed to alleviate that entire process of building your process and making it work for you. It is not a process itself, but a way of designing them.

You can’t run a project with EARN, but you can design how a project should run.

Stay tuned for more on it, soon.
