I have the belief that all current attempts to fix the financial and economical issues of our society is likely to fail and more likely to result in a continuation of the existing power structures rather than change them.

Money is much like matter and has its own type of gravity. While we do not know what gravity is we can observe it – the same can be said about the nature of monetary gravity. We can observe that it tends towards itself and the larger the pool the more gravitation power it wields over other money.

This has resulted in the same result time and again – regardless of political parties, administrations, or really anything of any significance – because it forms the foundation that they all stem. There is no power outside of money – even the governments are slaves to its momentum and those who try to manipulate their economies through force typically end up destroying them in the process.

This is because at the core is the belief in how money should work and the mechanisms of its creation. If we continue to believe the axioms which form the basis of the current monetary system – we will continue to have the exact same problems because they aren’t legislative, political issues that any one government can fix – they instead are the foundations that these governments have themselves formed from – to solve the problem requires recognizing the true cause.

The problem is centralized currencies. Nation states are the only entities who can have a means of transferring wealth outside of physical trade. This then makes them wholly responsible for all the output and the scarcity that comes as a result of the currency. Recently we have seen attempts by crypto-currencies as an attempt to resolve this problem of central banks – and they solved some neat challenges along the way – we now have ways to fix many of the problems involved in money — well….problems based on the foundations we currently have on money. I believe that whilst their intentions and their execution have been along the correct avenues, I do not think they solve the problem I am talking about.

They form another type of centralized control – whilst in many of these cases you can argue for forking and generating your own chain or cryptocurrency – each begins to suffer the same fate – they all require mass adoption for universal utility and they each suffer from different models of scarcity and control and finally – because of the two above mentioned issues they also generate a very strong gravitational effect within the currency itself. We see this within the crypto-trading and speculation markets that led to the massive bubble in 2017. This once again is due to the gravitational effects of money and people’s desires to acquire more and more of it because in essence – if you have a lot of money you have a lot of power (or opportunity).

This leads to a scarcity of opportunity and power and begins to result in a wealth gap (otherwise called the middle class in a ‘healthy’ socio-economy) that is just really a disparity localized to certain demographics and populations within the greater whole. This in effect perpetuates a false scarcity and likens it to a false productivity and together is used to manipulate the population and the economy on a whole.

Now, let me be clear that when I use the word manipulation – I am not referring to some specific shadowy figure pulling strings – I am instead referring to the massive momentum that is the world financial system. It is the whole machine that continues to push this concept forward and keep it alive – it is not any single bank, group of people, or even government (unless you want to include the whole world perhaps??)

This configuration is almost ubiquitous amongst the worlds countries – some just have more mobility and various slightly differences in policies and freedoms – but the general premise is typically the same. A central currency is recognized as legal tender and is utilized through a collection of taxes and debt instruments that forces the citizens and those who wish to trade with that nation to adopt and utilize this currency. This then in turn is the motor which runs the world.

We are told (falsely IMO) that this motor is the only motor that can effectively run the world – and that the governments have been entrusted to run these motors much likes priests of old were entrusted the knowledge and scrolls of the nation. I believe I may have found a possible way of rewiring the world and setting up a new type of motor to run it. For those who are familiar with “Atlas Shrugged” – I liken my model for the economy on the motor that John Galt designed ( and perhaps the current system is the *Motor of the World* I wish to stop).

Introducing Numis
-----------------

Proxi Numis is a new system to manage money, credit, and redesign the way that people interact with money. Perhaps money is not the right term, but since it is the closest concept – I think it is still accurate – despite the differences.

Numis builds upon a **single idea** – that we should each have sovereign banks of our own – we should be able to issue our own financial currencies and debt much as the central banks do today. We should be able to build our credit, issue debt and raise money through bonds and all such available instruments. We should be able to control our own interest rates and set the terms of our lending. We should recognize that technology has empowered us, but we remain presently slaves to an antiquated banking system – now its time to change this.

This is a radical idea – and one that is possibly so massive it cannot be achieved through any type of transitionary initiative – instead I believe that the only way to truly establish such a system is to separate it completely and wholly from the current status quo. We should develop a breakaway society built around this concept of independent banking and self-sovereignty.

Proxi Numis will form the central foundation that will power an entirely new economy for the Proxi Network – one which by design will not fall victim to problems with the current financial system.
