# Final Fantasy VIII &#8211; The Best Game Ever?
~ 2020-01-12T00:47:59+00:00 ~

What I am about to say is probably going to be heresy to some, and for others you will likely just brush it off and decide that my opinion is just different from you own, but I truly do believe that there is something magical about Final Fantasy VIII (FF8).

Ever since I first played FF8, I have been enchanted with it. The story is not without its flaws and the gameplay is not perfect, but I am going to try and explain some of the reasons why I feel it is one of the best games ever made. I will list a couple of my contenders at the end of the article and may provide follow up articles about them as well, but for this article the focus is on Final Fantasy VIII.

### Gameplay

The game is undoubtedly an JRPG, and in this case provides game play as such. You control a cast of characters whom you can level up, customise their equipment, adjust their stats, and attach special magical entities known as Guardian Forces (GF’s) which provide you the ability to junction magic. The game play is a mix of third-person exploration alongside time-based action using the ATB system.

While there is not much to say about the game play that cannot be said about other games, there is a nice combination of customisation despite not having a crafting system beyond a shallow weapon shop. The battles can begin to feel a little repetitive, but levelling is pretty quick and the enemy difficulty is dynamic so you can choose to grind but are rarely forced or encouraged to. The game also provides you the ability pretty early to reduce the frequency of battles through one of the GF’s abilities.

### Plot

Now for anyone who has played the game through until the end, you know that the plot can get a bit convoluted, but I think that this provides a bit of charm without detracting from the enjoyment of the experience. The plot alone is reason to replay the game as there are so many small plot points scattered throughout the world that a first-time player can easily miss. The gravity of these minor details is somewhat difficult to explain because I find many of them to be poignant commentaries about different aspects of life that do a lot to add depth to the characters.

The first Act of the plot is primarily focused around Squall and his fellow SeeD members who get caught up in a resistance movement vying for independence. This quickly transforms into a global story of power, politics, history, and relationships. Many of the themes have to deal with individual experiences and perspectives surrounding global events and there is a large underlying plotline which threads itself through time that links many of the seemingly unrelated events together. Time and space become part of the plotline late into the story.

While it may be difficult to follow the first time playing, upon further playthroughs and exploration of the world, you come to really appreciate the characters and the history of the in game world. Emotions never come second in this game and within every story are threads of emotion which are enhanced through the beautiful musical score that accompanies the game. Motivations may not always be fully expressed through dialog, but emotions are hard to mistake in this game. It also deals with a lot of questions about identity and belief.

After having played this game on a number of platforms and over almost 2 decades, I have yet to be bored by the story and find something new to appreciate upon every visit.

### Side Quests

Final Fantasy VIII is a game which is filled with hidden content. Many small side quests exist and they are not always easy to spot. There are hidden GF’s that require you to either defeat them in battle or draw them from bosses, magical draw points that are both hidden in rooms, but also across the map. There are magazines which can be found that provide hints about some of this content, and others are stumbled upon by exploring and talking to everyone.

Without a guide, it is difficult to find everything that this game has to offer. Many of the games best kept secrets are not only difficult to find, but difficult to complete if you aren’t prepared properly. Some of the hidden bosses are the most difficult in the game, but nothing in the game is what I would call unfair. It provides you with ample opportunity and for anyone who has the patience it is certainly possible to find many of the hidden items without needing to ruin the experience by looking in a guide.

### Consumability

I would say that it is easy to spend 60-100 hours playing this game if you attempt to complete the side quests and do not have a guide. The story is probably close to 30-60 hours and the side quests can take a considerable amount of time if you do not know where to begin, so for those who want a meaty game to dig into, look no further.

The game can be as difficult or as easy as the user wants. If you are new it can be a little bit of trick to get the hang of, but for those of who have played a bit and know the mechanics it is extremely consumable. I believe this may be one of the reasons I still find this game so favourable and possibly my favourite. It is such a quick game to pick up and get into. The plot gets started within the first 2 hours of game play, and from there you can choose to focus on the story and avoid combat by doing the minimum, or you can be a completionist and grind it out a bit.

Only the final battle is truly difficult, where as most battles are as difficult as you make them. The game features a unique junction system which many people have differing opinions on. While many complain it made the game too easy, this is great for new users who learn to utilise it. For users who do not understand the junctioning system, the game can be quite difficult and gruelling. This allows players to adjust their difficulty by merely changing their junctions. All in all, I think it is a very accessible game.

### Main Reason

While each one of the reasons above are not going to sell someone on their own merit, together they provide a compelling reason (or at least they should). The game manages to provide a consumable form of entertainment while still providing depth and breadth. Its rare that a game can consistently provide 30-50 hours of gameplay upon successive playthroughs and can still remain fresh and fun. It has everything I want in a good game – characters I care about, fun gameplay that is tweakable, but not complicated, and a story that continues to progress even if it is a bit complicated. And finally, replayability – lots and lots of it.

If you have never played it, I would highly encourage it. I recently bought it again on Nintendo Switch as they released an enhanced version with new textures and a rebuilt model. It provides some neat shortcuts that makes the game extremely digestible and great on a portable. Give it a try!
