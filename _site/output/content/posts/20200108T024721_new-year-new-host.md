# New Year &#8211; New Host

I have some plans to transfer this website from its current residence (AWS) to my own personal server. The reason for this is mainly do to with the fact that I want to run a few different personal hobby sites, but prefer to have access to my data for physical backups. While it is less fault tolerant than AWS, my own server should prove completely adequate for these purposes.

I love AWS and was running this website on their free tier – however, I do not have Ads on this site, and do not really want to add any to it either though I make no promises except that if I do, it will be tastefully done. That being the case, I do not really want to pay to host it alongside the database it requires and a load balancer (the real cost!). With all the prices set in USD, it is painful when the exchange occurs to CAD and the final tally is fully costed. Especially for such a simple WP website.

So, because I find it a lot easier to manage issues directly on my own machine than most cloud images and I can remote access it just the same it seems like the obvious choice. This all couple with the fact that I can keep my system up-to-date and versioned how I want it – not when AWS eventually gets around to it, makes this option very appealing.

So, that being said – this website may go down for a short period, but that will be the reason. Once I have migrated it, I expect to continue as it has been going.
