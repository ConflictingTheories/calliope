# Capturing Emotions

One of the main reasons that I enjoy having a blog is that it provides me with another method to express myself. It is a lot like journaling, but rather than for oneself it is aimed at the public. It is certainly not the best for everything but that is why there are so many [different hobbies](https://kyledm.ca/projects-ideas/) that one can appreciate and partake in.

 In addition to having a blog I try to keep a healthy amount of other hobbies going as one probably should. One such hobby is trying to desperately teach myself piano.

#### Slow Progress

I originally bought myself my electric keyboard in 2012 on a whim and decided that it would be good to learn a musical instrument which could provide a lot of variety. The piano interested me because of its variability in genre, and with electric keyboards and MIDI controllers it seemed like it also provided additional opportunities into some more digital excursions should I decide to go that route. I definitely wanted to get as close to a real piano as a could, but without breaking the bank because I had not yet decided if I was going to be any good or even really enjoy it. In the end, I chose a Casio weighted 88-key digital piano for around $250.00 that was on sale.

I must say I have been very impressed with it. All these years later and it still works and I haven’t really had any issues with it once. Despite having it all these years – I have not been as diligent as I may have wished. I discovered very early that I do not enjoy playing other people’s music very much. There are a few songs here and there that I would like to pick up, but not a ton of easy beginner songs. Because of this, I have been slow to pick up reading music – I can do it….but its not quick and its kind of an annoyingly painful process. You may be thinking at this time, “so…have you done anything or progressed at all?” and the answer is YES – but in something a little different – free-style.

#### Free-Style Piano

Instead of playing other people’s music, I have been trying to learn how to play music from more instinctual place and let it flow unpredictably each time, so that while I return to similar motifs, each experience is just a little different. In my hunt to improve on my free-style playing I have been focused on learning to play certain keys and because I am going for my own kind of styles and sounds – I do not try to look up inspirations of other people’s work in those keys. Instead I try out different chords, combinations, octaves, transitions, and small micro-patterns to see if I can find something that sounds good.

Sometimes I get on a roll and just feel the music align with my emotions and thoughts and it feels like I am playing out an adventure or storyline in the music. There are epic moments of strife, bitter betrayals, loss of hope, and rekindled passions that can spring up in the act of playing a free-style piece. Because I do not necessarily know how the story will end – sometimes it leaves me feeling emotionally different from when I first started playing.

#### Emotional Roleplay

Some sessions start of because I have had a stressful day and need to clear my mind – these sessions usually start off a bit on the rough side. Its tough to get relaxed, find anything that sounds good and fits the mood, and usually I end up falling back on some simple patterns I have in my repertoire. If I persevere just enough though, I usually can find a hook and jingle that sounds good and from there I can let my mind finally get away from the outside annoyances and instead get absorbed by the music.

Other sessions start off from a place of energy and sometimes I need to calm down and focus a bit more because my mind is racing and I have a thousand thoughts all at once – this is when I turn to the piano to focus a lot of brain’s sensory data with a single action and moment. This interrupts my brain’s short-circuits by overriding them and forcing me to focus. It has been extremely beneficial in this regard a tool for relaxation as much as it has been beneficial in providing me energy and a positivity boost at times.

It has even provided me the ability to express sadness as well as empathise with other’s suffering – as some music evokes a story or tale of heartache, pain, and other challenges which life throws our way.

#### Capturing the Moment

I have found that music can directly penetrate to heart of your feelings in ways that very few things can – but when that moment is created by free-style music, you sometimes find yourself chasing a moment you can no-longer reproduce. I have had many sessions which were just extraordinarily good. Other sessions are extraordinarily bad and truth is the good ones could have been nothing more than my aggrandising of the past, but it pains me to know I will never have a record to share.

Because of this, I have decided to try and record more of my free-style sessions. In part so I can review and approach them from a different place and time to see if under those circumstances I feel differently or notice different aspects of the music, and secondly so I can review them over time to look for areas to improve. One such tool I have found to help me on this quest is `musescore` which is a tool that helps people directly transcribe their playing into sheet music. All you do is connect to your digital piano and begin recording. It will then transcribe the sheet music for you in your chosen key and afterwards you can tweak and adjust the music. You can also play the music back through your keyboard and see how it sounds when something else plays it.

I am hoping that with some recordings, some sheet music, and a little more practice I will be able to add another section to this blog to showcase some of my music. Thanks for reading and keep an eye out.
