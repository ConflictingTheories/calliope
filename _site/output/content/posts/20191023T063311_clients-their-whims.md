# Clients &#038; their whims

This is a humorous post about some of the fun struggles you can have with clients. As a project manager you want to service them to the best of your ability and see that their projects are delivered smoothly, but far too often are their decisions difficult to manage.

Everyone has experienced or at least is familiar with the classic trope of a pushy client and an exascerbated but diligent project manager. You can already imagine the enthusiasm by which the client proclaims a new feature or request and the dread the proceeds to wash across the PM’s face. Its classic humour and its funny because its close to home for many.

Working in software you tend to get clients who are are focused on a building a platform or a product in software – many of these clients are unfamilar with the inner workings of a the latest programming frameworks let alone know what they mean – hence why they are buying your services. Its unfortunate that software does not lend itself to the possibly flitting fancies of some clients as easily as they may imagine.

Many a line of code has been written for naught. We have all seen git commits that go to nowhere – deadend branches with semi-completed functionality and a swath of TODOs and notes that will never see completion. Some projects shelved in favour of a new idea or a different direction. As a PM it can be tiring to put in the work to plan something, get it started and then have to grind the gears to a halt and redesign everything again.

This is where I find fault with agile methods to some degree – they are very wasteful in some ways. Sure, they have their benefits and for some projects are a perfect fit, but they can be very costly to something that is hard to measure – team morale. Agile doesn’t seem to provide an effective morale boost – it boils things down largely into a repetitive routine and a lot of subjective measurements which can get a bit meta at times. I think that in exchange for agility you lose some of the cohesion and focus that longer design phases can bring about. Having something new to work on to half completion every two weeks is fun at first and then becomes a never-ending battle of man-against-story – there is a reason they call a bunch of them epics – its a miracle when one finally finishes.

As a final close – I will leave you with a meme I find funny. This certainly doesn’t represent clients as a whole or even in general, but it is certainly something that comes up from time to time and I think this captures the essence of it.
