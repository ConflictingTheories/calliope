This article is obviously meant to be humorous per the name above, but the focus will indeed be on some hacks you can apply at certain fast food chains. Most of these I discovered while I was a student in university – a student is always looking for a deal – and these helped my dollars go a little bit further.

- **A&amp;W** – aka Customisation Heaven! You are able to customise your orders pretty extensively for free – you can edit the bun type, the toppings (add + remove) which provides more options for every meal. Burgers and breakfast sandwiches apply, but technically you can add it to anything – side of tomatoes anyone? I used to modify the menu items and had a preference for a couple of options.
  - Classic Breakfast + Lettuce &amp; Tomatoes + Combo =&gt; BLT Sandwich + Eggs + Hashbrown &amp; Coffee – ~$7
  - Double Buddy + Lettuce &amp; Tomato &amp; Sliced Onion &amp; Pickles on a seeded bun – ~$3
  - Breakfast Sandwich Combo + Lettuce &amp; Tomato – ~$7
  - Here is a cheatsheet:
      - Bun Types: *Unseeded(buddy), Seeded(mama,papa,etc), 7-Grain(chicken), English Muffin(breakfast)*
      - Toppings: *Lettuce, Tomato, Sliced Onion, Grilled Onion, Pickles*
      - Sauces: Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo
- **OPA**! – You can usually have them add all the toppings you get on a wrap onto your fries too!
- **McDonald’s** – Usually with McD’s you need to look at the value menu but first check if they have a deal on. Frequently they have a deal going. Otherwise, you can usually get away with substituting the drink with a coffee or a tea, and then just load up on the McChicken and McDouble burgers.
- **Miscellaneous** – There are a lot of ways to eek a little more from your fast food experiences – this usually requires making small side-requests just after you finish paying for the main meal. Usually, employees will give away an extra sauce or an extra topping if you throw it after the payment has gone through – not always, but a lot the time this works. Another tip is if you like veggies, they rarely are listed on the sides menu as priced items for extras – this can give you some hope that by asking for extra veggies it will be seen as a customisation and not as adding more product (such as is with meat which is always priced) – so next time just try asking for some extra veggies on your subs and bowls.
- **Coupons** – Obviously, coupons should be used if you have them. I had a ton of coupons when I was in university and I used them – most of the minor hacks listed above can be combined with coupons as well.
