# Beliefs &#038; Values
~ 2020-06-17T02:17:09+00:00 ~

I want to take a break from my usual posting which I try to keep light-hearted, and take a moment to talk about something that is more serious – beliefs &amp; values.

I am staunch proponent that the minimum is vocalising your beliefs and values if they are being oppressed or you are being told to act contrary to them. If the audience is reasonable – they will usually respect your beliefs and values and leave it at that – and in some cases they may even share those same values and beliefs and it will provide a good chance to bond over a misunderstanding. If the audience is not reasonable they will typically enforce their beliefs through authority (or assumed authority) despite your contrary views if they can – or will resort to more debased forms of retort. Sadly – this typically causes both sides to eventually slide into disagreement beyond understanding or repair if it continues.

I like to consider myself a man of principles first but with some additional insights that help provide other values. At the core would be my central tenet that values **reason**\* and it allows me to form a central measure of things. It also – reasonably – recognises that there is going to be a disconnect between my reason\* and Reason in the purest sense. I cannot possibly know everything which means I will have some error in my reasoning. The second tenet values **creation** and champions my belief that creation is a primarily good act and we should strive for it. The third major tenet values **growth** and helps me to believe we aren’t limited in time or place and that limitations can be removed. To follow that tenet equally is one which values **change** and believes in the ever-changing nature of existence and that things may only apply in a particular time and form before they are inevitably changed in some fashion. My fifth and final tenet values **freedom** and the belief that freedom should be available for all people, but it comes below the other values which should be held as the standards by which freedom is sought for it should be justifiable with at least another value and should never be the sole value.

We should be free to grow on the back of reason and champion the ideas of creation and growth and change and stop being told that this is how things are because those in authority tell us to follow them even though we know because of the above that it is antiquated, old, derelict and in need of repair – but rather than applaud us for finding faults and suggesting improvements we are brandished as the problem itself and that if only we were more akin to the rest of the system and didn’t try to change it we would be happier – and regardless they tell you that is how it will be and that you have to do it but at this point they typically fail to depend on reason anymore – for when asked to supply reason they do not do anything but curl the question and provide no reason but rather just a dance of avoidance or non-reasoned-replies that fail to be clearly identified – no we need to recognise the nature of this as what it is and call it the name it rightly deserves – authoritarian – those who do as they desire not as they reason.

Peaceful movements like strikes, protests, boycotts, and voting are what make society a great place to live – but those movements are typically rooted in shared respect and dignity towards one another – if one side or both begin to disregard the respect and dignity that should be attributed – there is little but to escalate or deflate. Small movements have a sad tendency to deflate at first – but given enough time and enough repetition – these movements will rise up and begin to escalate. Large movements are typically the culmination of many small failed attempts finally surging together in unison. At times like these – authoritarians act in the worst possible way – they draw out the people whose tenets are at the centre of the movement and try to control and dominate them through less than peaceful means.

I am not in favour of violence – but when peaceful options are removed from the table – they do not leave many other paths. Corrupted and decayed options might as well be considered the same thing as removed options because they do not typically provide a fair mutual respect. And when violence is used against a movement – defence is the only answer and most of the time it is difficult to discern what is defence and what is retaliation – this begins to blur the lines.

Movements must remain vigilant and need leadership during these times otherwise they risk splintering – to avoid this – local forums and debates must be promoted at these protests and demonstrations – without a true and honest platform to speak and rally – the movements will start to splinter or get twisted by external forces. Giant parades are well and good – but we need to organise platforms – and allow for voices to be heard not just at the picket line – we need to provide deep content and not just broad content.

We must fix issues to the root and not just apply another coating that makes us feel good for the time being. True reason is forward thinking – not just in the moment and while it accounts for knowledge from the past – it should never be blinded by it or built solely from it. Change needs new ideas and new areas to take risks – if we only build from the past or look to it for answers or reasons to the problems – we will never see the solutions to them because they aren’t there.

We are blessed with foresight yet we rarely allow it to shape politics or govern our highest offices – instead we fall back on the present typically and the past if that fails. We dredge up old problems, but at the same time we hash out old solutions as well. We base our policies on past mistakes, and current and past lessons learned. We never take a risk and try something new in politics and this is what gives those with power their continued stranglehold on it. We like to say we have a democracy and that we have equal opportunity here – but rarely does that actually make any sense except at the micro-level. On a macro level it gets less and less reasonable because we start to include business opportunity, market opportunity, international opportunity, global opportunity, political opportunity, and financial opportunity.

The world is not efficient, in need of some serious change and I for one hope it comes – but not with violence but with reason.
