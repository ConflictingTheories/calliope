I have made some updates this week to [Calliope](https://calliope.site) and the changes can be see on this site too. I have deployed the latest version of Calliope and it is currently being used to run this site.

#### Ease & Simplicity is the Goal :star:

I am building Calliope to help with two main problems:

1. Platform Centralization
2. Free & Simple - Why Pay for Simple Stuff

I hope that I can support people and their freedom of speech without tying themselves to a platform or social media feed. Instead I hope that we can revisit ideas such RSS but based around people's own websites that pull in content much like social media (and even perhaps allows for messaging / notifications) - all without needing to host a large centrally managed service - nor require some black-magick technical skills to setup.

So far it is not 100% where I want it, but it is far from where it started and I am able to happily manage my blogs and websites whilst still retaining a bit of customization and control which I love.

---

I hope to continue to expand the project, but as it is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/conflictingtheories/calliope) I am also hoping that it perhaps sparks some interest in the community and some people can help expand it.

I will know I have succeeded when it is being used on other people's sites and they begin to (one day) pull and query their curated feeds and perhaps even publish them (alongside their own personal feeds of course). Together we can change and redefine the landscape and no longer depend on centralized servers, hosting, platforms or more and return to the good roots of the internets vision - protocols and standards. 

Clients and User Agents free to roam the internet to their hearts content - not tied to the giant tyrants of today.

Thank you and please consider giving it a shot! :+1: :star: :apple: :cactus:
