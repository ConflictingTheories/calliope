I have been working on a submission for the [PayID Hackathon – hosted on DevPost.](https://payid.devpost.com/) For my submission, I have decided to work towards one of my larger projects (read future) that I have been thinking about for some time.

I have decided to make [ProxiPay](http://proxi.kderbyma.com).

Right now – it is not much more than a wallet generator, and payment gateway with some additional XRP features like trust lines and currency order / exchange.

I plan on making it a bit more structured and the goal will be to build a simple payment service which can one day help form the foundation of the [Proxi Network](https://proxi.network).

You can follow along with my progress via GitHub where I has hosted the code.
