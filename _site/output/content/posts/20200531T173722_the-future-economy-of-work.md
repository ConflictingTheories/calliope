# The future economy of work

I think there will be some BIG changes coming in the next few years (read 2-5 years) as the world slowly adapts to new technologies which are now becoming more ubiquitous as well as new social changes like the impacts of the various protest movements &amp; Covid-19 pandemic.

I think this will be necessitated by a massive global crisis which will threaten to underpin all the progress we have made in the last 30 years. Part of the problem is that most of the economic wealth is being sequestered into a few select companies – but these companies are typically consumerist in nature. They depend on a constant want and desire for more and lots of them focus around convenience. The problem is becoming that the things we want are so easy to get that they are losing their intrinisic value – but jobs we need to perform in order to get them are not getting any easier.

People in developing countries are looking into the developed world as a kid would through a shop window – salivating over those things they will have if they can just work hard enough or just get lucky enough. People in developed countries are not satisfied with these things, but have grown accustomed to always having something new to look forward to. For the last 30 years we have had novelty in abundance and technologies have been a large part of the novelty.

What happens then – when these technologies begin to empower only those who have massive wealth already. Most of the next generation of technologies being explored are not designed to improved the low end consumers, but rather make it easier to exploit them. However, if most of these jobs end up going away, then a large subset of wealth will increasingly be sequestered by these megacorps and will not find a way of being redestributed through the economy. This will lead to an indentured economy – one where everyone is sadly being driven by debt because they will have no means of ensuring future liquidity whilst rich and power organisations and their shareholders will risk holding onto something which one day loses all value.

I think the only option to avoid such an outcome is come up with a new economic model – one that is neither capitalism, communism, fascism, nor socialism. I want a different model – one which without technologies would otherwise seem impossible. I want a model that facilitates growth without sacrificing security or opportunity. I also want the model to not only provide opportunity in the moment, but across time as well – something capitalism cannot claim.

So how? Well – capitalism is based on the concept of competition – and I think there is a way to minimize the impacts of that decision whilst keeping some of the intrinsic values. Competition is good because it fuels growth – but it also can result in destructive forces and result in decay because both allow for differential measure of success.

My model would not allow for the differential to go down – their would be no incentive to “CRUSH” anyone as the incentive would not be to grow larger than all others, but to provide the greatest positive impact across the network. This would mean that to help someone else succeed would be economically beneficial to you and it would not be beneficial to try and compete against them maliciously, but it would be fine to compete independently of them.

What this means is that – mud-slinging would be an economic expense, whilst promotion, support, and friendly competition would be seen as valuable and beneficial. Scams – would appear like promotion, but would have not actual benefit and would result in negative economic gains in this model as well – as their would be no incentive to scam anyone.

I call my model **Exponentialism** and I think that it succinctly captures the essence – the only purpose is growth for the individual &amp; the network at neither’s expense. Value is created in the moment – that value can create new value in the future – there is no interest – that is all.
