## Welcome!

Calliope is a website builder and static-site generator. It helps manage the complexities within websites whilst giving you a distributable PWA (progressive-web app) which can be shared via a variety of means and hosted on both premium and paid services. It also comes with support for Docker, Static, and Live Hosting as well as its own Administrative Panel for Live Edittings and Previews.

- **Yola!** - This is a site about **Calliope **that is made using itself - It is a static site generator designed for blogging and simple content-driven websites.
- It is a work in progress 🛠️ - but it has 💖 and I hope you will try it for your own blogs which is what I am designing it for.
- It is based on markdown :pencil: - but the focus is on clearly dilineating the content from everything else (including the themes 🦸).
- It is still customizable ⚙️ but not quite as much any other one (considering its about 1 day old atm)
- Btw - Calliope was one of the [Ancient Greek Muses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope) if you are wondering about the name.
- EnjoY! 🌵🌵🌵
