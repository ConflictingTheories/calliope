## Short Codes

You can also use custom Shortcode and perform your own expansion based on the short codes. Expand it with plugins and tap into all the fun.

Some areas which are coming soon for plugins:

- IPFS Support for Streaming & Hosting
- Embedded Widgets & Galleries
- Crypto

Ex. Pass Through Params and Make Custom Plugin Shortcodes
[[ CustomShortCodes customParam1="Custom Params" <}}

Ex. IPFS-Hosted Video Streaming
