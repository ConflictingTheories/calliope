## Hello World! 🌎 - inspired by Calliope [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9488b97a-8436-455f-a2b8-e226c7cae882/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nifty-tesla-992896/deploys)
- Yola! - This is a site that is made using Calliope - a static site generator.
- It is a work in progress 🛠️ - but it has 💖 and I hope you will try it for your own blogs which is what I am designing it for.
- It is based on markdown :pencil: - but the focus is on clearly dilineating the content from everything else (including the themes 🦸).
- It is still customizable ⚙️ but not quite as much any other one (considering its about 1 day old atm)
- Btw - Calliope was one of the [Ancient Greek Muses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope) if you are wondering about the name.
- EnjoY! 🌵🌵🌵
