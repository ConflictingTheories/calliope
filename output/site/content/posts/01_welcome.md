## Welcome!
- **Yola!** - This is a site about **Calliope **that is made using itself - It is a static site generator designed for blogging and simple content-driven websites.
- It is a work in progress 🛠️ - but it has 💖 and I hope you will try it for your own blogs which is what I am designing it for.
- It is based on markdown :pencil: - but the focus is on clearly dilineating the content from everything else (including the themes 🦸).
- It is still customizable ⚙️ but not quite as much any other one (considering its about 1 day old atm)
- Btw - Calliope was one of the [Ancient Greek Muses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calliope) if you are wondering about the name.
- EnjoY! 🌵🌵🌵
